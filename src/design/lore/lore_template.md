# Short, Properly Capitalized Title

Your title should convey the basic jist of your proposed changes. It should be short because the text will be linked in the sidebar.

| Writers | Game Changes Required | GitHub Links |
|---|---|---|
| Your Names Here | :white_check_mark: Changes Required or :warning: Changes Recommended or :x: No | Game PR Links or TBD |

`Writers` should be the names that you use on GitHub and/or Discord. This is optional but strongly recommended, since:

- This acknowledges credit where it is due
- People who are confused about the written intent can use this information to contact the authors
- For larger scale collaborations, list the main organizers

`Game Changes Required` is if the proposed lore change requires changes made to game itself, or design philosophy and direction. 

Github links can include multiple PRs. Game design PRs are not required, but a helpful addition if they are associated with the proposed lore change.

## Required Affirmation

-- Confirm the following by placing an X in the brackets [X]: 
- [ ] I acknowledge that my lore contribution can be iterated on in the future, and potentially changed. Lore is a community project from all members and of mutual ownership, though properly attributed to writers.
- [ ] I acknowledge that lore and development work in tandem, and both can change each other. Lore can and will be changed as required to fit the needs of greater development goals.
-- You should understand that not following the above may get your proposal closed at lore maintainer’s discretion --

## Overview

A very short, maybe three sentence summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this adds".

## Background

Summarize any information that is needed to contextualize the proposed changes, e.g. vision for how this changes the game, reasoning for the change, goals for future work.

Also link any relevant discussions on Discord, GitHub, or HackMD that are relevant to the proposal.

## Setting Impact

Describe how much the proposed lore change will affect the greater setting at large. Is this a small change, or something more foundational to the setting itself and how we see it? How much will this shift how people interact with and envision the game? If the proposal will affect or change the playerbase's approach and perception towards the game, describe the potential positives and negatives you forsee.

Examples:
| Low | Moderate | High |
|---|---|---|
| Fun facts about an asteroid in deep space | Introduction of a new company or faction | Nanotrasen and the Syndicate are in an alliance|


## Required Dev Work

How much work is required to properly reflect this lore change in game? Is it a low impact change or high? Are there any plans to implement this change already organized? If dev work is required, has discussion occured with associated parties who contributed to the current setup?

Examples:
| Zero| Low| Moderate | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zero work needed | Changing wording on select documents |Creation of new mechanics or art, potentially several PRs| Nanotrasen's color scheme is now Red and Gold, except on Tuesdays|

## Design and Lore Space

Lore is an ever shifting and collaborative effort, working in tandem with the game development. Does this change provide new space for lore and game development or does it shrink it? Does it close off or limit further creative development in this space, or does it provide a launching off point for further efforts? 

## Roundflow & Player interaction

What sort of gameplay or roleplay changes will result from this change, both from a player and admin side? Do you envision it having an impact on how rounds play or feel? Do you feel these changes will arise organically, or will they require prodding and reinforcement?

## Game Design Rationale

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?


## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?
