## Overview 

A proposal to partially rework salvage in order to more clearly define its role as a resource provider for the station,
While also much more appropriately rewarding the salvagers who do so,
As such, this document has three primary proposals. 

### Features to be added

## Salvage Tickets 

Salvage Tickets would be a very straightforward solution for the problem of salvagers not focusing on resource gathering,
inspired on how it exists in SS13 and certain 14 servers, when salvagers process raw ores or scrap, they also get salvage tickets.

These tickets can then be exchanged inside a special vendor for items and equipment salvagers want, such as medical supplies, tools, weapons and suits.

The vendor would not be able to be moved and taken aboard the salvage ship, meaning in order to use it, they have to return to cargo to redeem tickets for equipment,
In doing so, gathering materials and getting equipment are something that go hand in hand. 

ideally leading to scenarios where salvagers will first go safely gather materials and process them, 
and use the tickets they gain to get the equipment that will allow them to take on more risky locations. 


## Salvage packages 

In short, Salvage Packages are nearly the same as regular mail packages that cargo receives from the mail teleporter.

But they have a few key differences: 

- Salvage packages are only ever found from salvage itself, spawning as part of wrecks, ruins and debris. 

- Instead of being addressed to a specific individual like cargo mail, salvage packages are addressed to a department, 
  and anyone that has said departments access is capable of unlocking and opening it.

- Unlike cargo mail, packages primarily contain items related to the department it is intended for.
 
  (Meds for medical, food/ingredients for chefs, mutated seeds or hydro chems for botany and so on)
 
- If a salvage package is opened, they gain a large bonus of additional salvage tickets that they can spend, 
  possibly with a direct spesos reward for cargo as well. 

Salvagers themselves are not able to do anything with the packages,
but rather are meant to bring these back to the station to receive the reward.

while the department in question gets their hands on some useful or otherwise less common items. 
this helps address the issue of station crew feeling like salvage is not working, or are detached from the station,
and allows departments to occasionally get their hands on some more exotic items. 

(Such items could even be low-mid level contraband for added spice.)

## Mining/Scraping Rework and Rebalance

A set of changes to attempt to unify mining and scraping mechanics for the sake of streamlining the process. 

- The ore processor is no longer used to refine ores; instead, now both ores and scrap get processed in the recycler (renamed into the material processor). 
  [Due to the recycler not working properly with stacked items, a rebalance of ores will be required to account for them being non stackable.]

- Ores or scrap items that are thrown into the recycler now also print out a ammount of salvage tickets 

- Ore bags can also be used to also hold scrap items, regular ore bags buffed to be a 10x5 (from 10x4),renamed into the scrap bag.

- A new item bag known as the material bag that works like the ore/plant bag, but only holds regular materials instead (steel, glass, plastic, plasma, gold, silver and so on), 
  possibly unlocked from research and replaces the spot taken by the industrial ore processor, holds up to 8 stacks of items,
  could even have its own bluespace variant that's unlocked alongside the bluespace ore bag. 

- Coal now gets recycled into a small amount of diamonds rather than being used for steel, so now it's also possible to get some amounts of it from magnet mining.  

- Fixing of the bug that causes getting doubled drops when used with certains mining tools.
 (Yes, is a bug apperently, or just incredible goob jank) 

# Cargo Departamental TechFab 

To make up for the removal of the industrial ore processor and its ability to make plasteel, plasma/uranium glass and its reinforced versions,

A new departmental techfab would be added for cargo specifically; it would also be used to make a majority of cargo/salvage-specific items such as drills, fultons, and scanners. 

In the future this could even be used to expand on the idea of salvage finding unique blueprits to unlock new things to make inside of the techfab

## Game Design Rationale

Salvage, as it exists currently, is intended to be a resource provider for the station, but a not uncommon problem is that salvage players forgo doing this in favour of looting for personal gain while keeping the needs of the station secondary, if even that. 

The reason I believe this is the case (and why I wrote this design document) is that salvagers gathering equipment for themselves and materials for the station are mostly separate tasks.

A salvager who spends all of their time mining asteroids will be able to provide the station with plenty of materials,
but because the salvagers themselves gain very little in doing so,
most choose to do other activities such as VGRoid, Magnet wrecks or Expeditions, as those give much more direct rewards while also being more mechanically interesting to do.
So salvage tickets are being introduced to hopefully solve multiple problems at once:

-Salv equipment progression being mostly based on RNG drops and just hoping you find what you want or need. 

-Salvagers not focusing on what is intended to be the their primary goal , to provide the station with resources.

-Salvagers rarely, if ever, having a reason to interact with regular station crew and, more importantly, rarely giving out items that could be useful for them.

## Roundflow & Player interaction

The general roundflow for salvage would not be changed too much, other than given them difrent kinds of priorities to work towards, the bigest change expected is them making more regular return trips to the station in order to drop off supplies, and to turn in any tickets they earned for more equipment,
that way, if a regular station crewmember sees a highly equiped salvager, they can more resonably assume they actualy did do their job properly.

Due to salvage packages giving out tickets for being opened, means its expected that salvagers themseleves that will go out to get them delivered and opened rather than leaving them for the other cargo techs to do, and so increasing the ammount of interactions salvagers have with other people, alowing salvagers to feel more apreciated and as part of the station crew. 


## Seriously Silly

Salvage packages can open up a number of new possibilities, one time a chef might get some mundane ingredients from it, another might get some kind of random creature cube, or a dehydrated carp, or just a dinousour cube. Getting certain exotic items might help throw an unexpected curveball into a round.
