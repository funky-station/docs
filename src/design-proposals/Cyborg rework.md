# Overview

Currently, cyborgs are considered by a lot of the playerbase to be one of the more boring roles to play. The proposed changes here serves as a plan of action for future development to attempt to enrich the role more, and give it more RP presence within rounds.

The changes planned with this rework is for borgs to be more involved with their on station roboticist/acting roboticist. Currently, borgs only visit for upgrades very briefly for better cells, with some chassis not even requiring further upgrades to their modules, leading to a lot of Borg players inadvertently playing against funky's core design philosophy of “RP first.”

In the rework, I'd like to ensure that every single chassis has equal opportunity to visit their roboticist for upgrades to their current chassis, and not being a “one and done” deal upon selection, which some chassis selections suffer from, such as the service chassis or engineering chassis. 

The summary of the changes are as follows:

- All borg chassis should start significantly weaker that how they will eventually be in the lategame.
- Each borg chassis should have equal opportunity to get upgrades.
- Borgs should be better than their crew staff counterpart in the lategame on their own.
## Features to be added
***
### Engineering Chassis

The engineering chassis has one of the strongest starts when it comes to borgs. Before the borg selection rework, the RCD module was something that had to be researched, and made for the engineer borg. Starting with a regenerating RCD is TOO strong in my opinion, and having it be an upgrade that the borg gets matches up with the design philosophy I aim for with this rework. 

- Engineering chassis no longer starts with an RCD module. Instead, this will be unlocked via research with advanced tools.
- The RCD module can now also print pipes.
- The materials module can now also hold plasteel.
- Increase doafter time for interactions with the advanced tools module.

### Salvage Chassis
Currently, the salvage chassis struggles with the fact it's only useful for mining, and mining only. This leaves salv borgs most of the time seperating from the salvage team, as the only benefit they'll have for them is easy repairs in fights. The changes here help the salvage chassis be more useful for salvagers that prefer mags or wrecks, while also keeping them strong in the mining department.
- The salvage chassis now starts with a basic mining module instead of the mining module, containing a radio and pickaxe.
- The normal mining module is now unlocked with research, with salvage equipment.
- Add a salvaging module, moving the shovel and crowbar from the mining module to itself, and adding a fulton slot.

### Medical Chassis
For the most part, the medical chassis is the default of what I want the other chassis to be up against. It's upgrade tree of getting defibs and eventually the borg hypo, making regular visits to the roboticist is exactly what I wish to see for the other borg types too. That's not to say this chassis is perfect, there's still some changes I wish to make with this one.

- Add an advanced topicals module.
- Add soap to the surgery module, or make the advanced surgery module the default. Currently the default surgery module is broken, dirtying without the borg knowing.
- Add a paramed module, giving the borg a medical scanner and other utilities for on the go medical aid as a lategame research.

### Service Chassis
This one's a bit of a tricky one, as it's shortcomings mainly derive from the way that borgs are designed. A lot of service roles require hands, which cyborgs don't have. It's a challenge and sometimes nigh impossible to fulfill certain service tasks with this chassis as a result.
Here are two potential ideas to fix this:

1. EXTREMELY experimental, would require extensive play testing and admins watching during said tests, but give the service Borg the unique ability to have a singular hand, but an automatic pacifist implant on selection of the chassis. This is a VERY powerful tool to give a cyborg, though I'm not sure what else would work. If this avenue is chosen, the service modules should be significantly nerfed or removed.
2. Redefine the service Borg to be more of a SEC and command helper with paperwork and RP enrichment. Aim to have the standard for service Borgs be lawyer work, paperwork filing and delivery, and the such. With this, a bureaucracy module could be made with appropriate stamps.

### Antag balancing

Currently borgs are a pretty versatile asset for antagonists that choose to convert them, though a major drawback is that generally, it's only science that can even get a chance to EMAG them in most cases.
A traitor could in theory gain AA, or access break the Borg, but I'm fond of the idea of additional methods of EMAGing a Borg.

A proposed idea for this would be to allow crew to crowbar crit borgs to forcibly open their chassis to access their internals. This will permanently update their examine text to show that their panel is busted, but serve as a very quick and dirty way to get an ally, with an increased risk of getting caught as opposed to the regular method of subverting the Borg.
Another reason for this proposition is that playing Borg most of the time, is much too safe. In most cases, antag are going to stay well enough away from you, so most borgs don't ever really directly face a threat themselves. This would at the very least, make borgs more of a target, leaving them a lot less “safe” of a pick if you're trying to avoid antags with the role.

Additionally, crew cyborgs should be able to fit the L6 SAW module in their chassis. The edge cases where this can happen are obscenely rare, there being only two cases where this can happen;

1. The module dropping from salvage cave expeditions rarely, and the salvage being an antag that has access to the borgs panel
2. A Nukie round where an assault Borg has been destroyed, and command permits the usage of the module on a Borg, who would still of course need to follow their laws.

The chances of either happening are obscenely rare, but would be a very validating play in the rare chance it DOES happen. 

Finally, borgs that are crit should either lose their ability to speak, or lose their comms access. Death is way too forgiving for borgs, calling crew to your aid is too easy.
