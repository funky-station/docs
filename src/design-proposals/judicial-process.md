## Overview

This Doc puts a recent discussion into writing. Instead of Warden being the one who convicts and sentences, the Magistrate will be the one who determines what someone is guilty of, and what length their sentence is. And of course it will take place in the Courtroom

## Background

Currently the amount of Court and Law related shenanigans are too low. Lawyers and Magistrates would like some more attention, and honestly the Warden having 100% of the control over sentencing feels a little lacking RP wise

## Features to be added

Okay so when Security arrests someone the Inmate will be transported to the Processing room as usual. They will be searched for any contraband, and any personal items will be left in the processing room. Then the Inmate will be escorted to the courtroom. 

In the Courtroom guilt will be determined. Any evidence of the crime will be brought to the Courtroom by the escorting officer. Any witnesses or victims that were related to the crime that are willing to testify should be in the court too. The Magistrate will then proceed with a hasty trial to determine sentence and guilt.

The Inmate will be escorted back to processing where the Warden simply finishes locking up their personal items and gives them their Prisoner ID.

Now, for actual changes needed to take place

Both the Courtroom and the Processing room PLEASE need a Wanted Console. This is so that the Warden and the Magistrate can communicate crucial information about Inmates to everyone that needs to know.

The "Detained" status needs to have a description. For "Wanted" people, a description can already be added. For "Detained" people, the option to add a description is crucial here. This is so that when the Magistrate sentences an inmate, they can mark them as "Detained" and mark how much time they should be put in Brig for.

A new status needs to be added called "Awaiting Trial". This will be a status given to inmates that have been arrested. The Magistrate will be able to instantly see that their presence in Court is needed, which is necessary.

SOP Changes!

Some minor SOP changes need to happen so that everyone knows their role in these new trials.

Space Law should change, and all crimes should be ~doubled in length, so that these trials aren't occuring just for a 2 minute sentence lol. Should be good RP, which hopefully makes the longer waits feel worth it.

If the Magistrate is absent, then the NTR will substitute in for them. If the NTR and Magistrate are absent, then there will be no Court. I'm not going to ask the Captain to be present for every Court Case, so unless the Captain has free time and is willing to be the Judge, then the Judicial Process will halt and the system will just go back to the Warden sentencing Inmates in the Processing room.

In the event of a Red Alert, or a known threat worthy of a Red Alert is present, then the Judicial Process is halted. The Warden will sentence people in the Processing room like before.

A new system of Trials will probably have to be added, designed to simply establish guilt and sentence without taking time for irrelevant matters.


## Game Design Rationale

- This Judicial Process system will add many new ways to RP, and should bring consistent RP to lawyers and to CentComm personell. It should decrease the workload of the Warden aswell, and will make sentencing feel more RP'ing, instead of just rushing through sentence after sentence. Trials will be cool again, trust

## Roundflow & Player interaction

- This feature will be present in every round, since there is always Inmates. I want people that witness crimes and are victims to crimes to show up to Court on their own accord. Both to defend the Inmate and to Prosecute the Inmate. 

Magistrates should make sure they're communicating with Lawyers and IAAs since both of them usually like trials.

And the option to halt the Judicial Process is an option if Security is busy with greater threats, so it shouldn't ever be bothersome to attend Court as Security or CC.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact 

- This rule shouldn't require any additional admin intervention. People are already getting sentenced, this is just a more formal way of doing it
- I don't think this feature will add more potential for griefing. When Court becomes more frequent, there shouldn't be any Court bombers or anything
- The rules will just be enforced by the SOP mostly

# Technical Considerations

- As stated before, some Mapping Changes are required to add Wanted Consoles to the Processing room and the Courtroom
- Also as stated before, some of the status's need to be changed or added to make communication easier concerning Inmates
