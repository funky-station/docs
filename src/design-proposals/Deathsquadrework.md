## Overview/Game Design Rationale

Fundamentally, the concept of the Death Squad in SS14 is a strange one. It is both meta-shielded and top secret, yet historically it has been openly referenced, including through recruitment posters. The idea that Nanotrasen maintains a covert punishment and liquidation force is compelling, but even the name “Death Squad” is fundamentally flawed. No self-respecting megacorporation would refer to a classified internal enforcement unit with such blunt language.

Additionally, Death Squad currently utilizes quite a bit of Syndicate equipment to make up for their lack of options, which makes ZERO sense both in lore and in gameplay. While their unique hardsuits, pulse weaponry, masks, and overall visual identity fit their role, the use of Syndicate stimulants, energy swords, and shields undermines the idea that this is a corporate-controlled force rather than an external antagonist.

This document aims to address both issues by providing cleaner lore, a more believable naming scheme, and a clearer meta-shield stance, while also establishing unique equipment and a more accurate in-game depiction aligned with the intended role.

## Features to be added: Lore Changes
As stated above, no corporate entity like Nanotrasen would name its most secretive enforcement division “Death Squad”. Instead, such a unit would be framed in bureaucratic language that conceals its true purpose while preserving legal and organizational distance.

As such, this proposal establishes the External Affairs Enforcement Agency, or EAEA, as the primary enforcement branch operating under Central Command. The EAEA functions as the parent authority for all Central Command emergency response, enforcement, and escalation assets.

Within this structure, what was historically referred to as Death Squad is formally redesignated as ART, standing for Asset Recovery and Termination. ART is not a public-facing division and exists solely as a specialized enforcement arm of the EAEA. While “Death Squad” may persist as an informal or colloquial term among personnel, it is not an official Nanotrasen designation.

Internal Affairs concerns itself with station function, compliance, and the conduct of employees and command staff. External Affairs, by contrast, operates at the Central Command level and becomes involved only once internal mechanisms have failed. When an individual, group, or station is deemed an externalized liability, authority is transferred from Internal Affairs to the EAEA. At that point, corporate protections are revoked, and enforcement shifts from investigation to resolution, enforcing Nanotrasen’s will.

This structure also allows for a clear distinction between routine response forces and terminal enforcement actions. The EAEA is a known Central Command agency, though the full scope of its authority is not widely understood. Most crew members would reasonably assume the EAEA oversees emergency response coordination, provides security escorts for Central Command VIPs, and manages high-level contract enforcement actions. These functions are explicitly not meta-shielded.

Central Command personnel, including NTRs, IAAs, and Magistrates, would be aware that the EAEA maintains an extreme enforcement capability through ART deployments. ART units are authorized only in exceptional circumstances, such as mass misconduct by command and crew, systemic corruption, or the uncontrolled leakage of corporate secrets. In such cases, all non-Central Command contracts aboard the station are terminated. ART deployment represents Nanotrasen’s nuclear option.

Despite this mandate, ART doctrine emphasizes total crew elimination without catastrophic damage to the station itself. Personnel are replaceable. Stations are not.

Thus far, this document has focused on philosophy and lore redesign. However, several in-game changes are proposed to better support and reinforce this hierarchy.

First, the prefix for former Death Squad spawns and ERT should be changed to Agent, reflecting their status as EAEA operatives rather than military personnel. Existing ranks such as Corporal or Lieutenant should be removed, as they are inconsistent with both corporate structure and EAEA doctrine.

Second, all existing Death Squad equipment names and descriptions should be rewritten to reflect EAEA ownership and ART-specific deployment, ensuring the gear communicates corporate enforcement rather than external or syndicate origin.

Features to be added: Items 
In order to reflect a cohesive EAEA, we must remove the syndicate items and replace them with more options for agents to pick from, all while keeping it thematic, space-age, and objectively awesome.

ART, like nukies, will spawn in their hardsuit with their gas mask and basic gear, as well as a combat medical kit and pulse pistol in their bag, as well as a Bluespace Lifeline implant. They will otherwise be unarmed. The intended team size is 4, with all agents being of equal rank.

A new structure would be added that can be admin spawned, being effectively a NT version of a Nukie planet, yet being effectively a tiny, ATS-like (in terms of design) station with a matching, bare bones shuttle. It would have a new armory room with the following new EAEA-only weapons, with instructions to not take more than you can carry on your person onto the shuttle. 

Space Station 14s firearms are fundamentally made by FUCKING NEEEERDS who like esoteric gun ideas and cartridges. I am continuing the tradition to autistic levels.

The armory will have the following:  
- 1 Parabellum Peacemaker (New)
- 5 extra Parabellum Peacemaker 9mm drums (New)
- 1 Rammer (New)
- 5 extra Rammer 20mm mags (New)
- 2 Terminators (New)
- 4 extra 8 gage depleated uranieam buckshot boxes (New)
- 4 Pulse Rifles
- 4 portable rechargers
- 8 Advanced Combat Medipens
- 1 Artist Lawboard
- 4 Telescopic Shields


Item Name:
### Parabellum Peacemaker

Description:

Developed by the EAEA for use by ART agents, the General Purpose Anti-Personnel 9mm Rotary Machine Gun, often referred to as the Parabellum Peacemaker, is effectively a mini minigun using a Gatling-style electric action. The system recovers a portion of otherwise wasted firing energy to sustain the onboard battery, which rotates the barrels at a more consistent rate than a gas-based action and reduces sensitivity to fouling and ammunition variance even during heavy use.

Intended for personal contract termination, the 9mm cartridge was selected over a rifle-grade round due to its lower recoil, weight, profile, and thermal load, as well as reducing the risk of rebound in confined environments. The system feeds from large 9mm belts contained in disposable drums.

Implantation:

Creating the Parabellum Peacemaker in-game is by far the easiest new addition. This is because the Minigun is already a made gun, perfectly fits my idea in terms of damage, and is totally unused. We can literally just clone it and change the text and rounds. With the adoption of RMCs caceless rounds, it will also reduce the performance issues. The sprite itself works as well.

Logic:

Having fucked around with the Minigun and even used it in combat many times, it is a very fun gun. For those who have not used it, it fires a continuous beam of very accurate, low-damage projectiles. Where it thrives is not in time to kill. In fact, with armored targets, the gun can feel underpowered (fitting 9mm), but it has accuracy and sheer capacity. It fits a support weapon like the L6SAW perfectly, with 5+1 drums being more than enough to last an operation, especially if a squad is deployed late into a round.

The idea of a 9mm, man-portable mini minigun is objectively badass, and a man-portable electric rotary machine gun is objectively sci-fi as shit. It fits my design theme of being a gun that pushes the upper limits of practicality. It would be perfectly capable of killing the entire station 4 times over with drums to spare.

For those who care, AKA no one, the name itself refers to the 9x20 NATO round being also referred to as 9mm Parabellum. This comes from a 5th centry latin phrase translating to “if you want peace, prepare for war”, perfectly fitting NATO's doctrine. The Peacemaker comes from the Automatic Peacemaker item in Pixel Gun 3D (that game was my childhood), and so the name is essentially a nerdy as fuck pun. In addition, the item in Pixel Gun 3D was likely a nod to how the M134 Minigun was tested on the Fairchild AU-23A ‘Peacemaker’ aircraft.

Item Name:
### Rammer

Description:

Officially designed by the EAEA for use by ART agents as the 20mm Recoilless Anti-Material Rifle, and usually referred to as the 20RAMR, nicknamed ‘Rammer’, the 20RAMR brings the massive 20mm caliber into a semiautomatic, shoulder-fired, mobile rifle with a detachable magazine, intended for contract termination versus exosuit targets and penetrating plasteel walls. Offering a 4+1 round capacity, it uses a ‘recoilless’ operating system combined with a controlled, self-contained cycling action.

Rather than relying on a fixed barrel and conventional recoil absorption, the Rammer redirects a significant portion of propellant gas rearward through an open, vented system to balance forward momentum at the moment of firing. Simultaneously, the barrel assembly itself is permitted limited rearward travel, using that motion to manage impulse and cycle the weapon. 

Spent cartridges are expelled during this brief rearward movement, and the system uses a hydraulic recoil spring to reset forward immediately after stripping a new round and locking the barrel, keeping the action largely sealed during operation. Recoilless assisted short recoil action architecture reshapes the firing impulse to such a degree that the weapon can be fired from a standing shoulder position without requiring a bipod or cycling each round manually, otherwise impossible feats for a 20mm platform.



Implantation: 

My idea for a shoulder-fired, portable semi automatic ‘recoiless’ rifle fits the EAEA theme of total overkill. 

The Rammer is by far the most unique addition, yet it does not require from-scratch implantation. To reflect this, a 4+1 scoped gun (like the Hurstov), rate of fire of about 1/s, with each bullet having 1,000 structural, 300 piercing, and 300 blunt. That should make it a one-shot kill on any target, able to rip through any wall or door, and if a headshot or limbshot, shoot off the part. This is at the cost of only letting you carry max 25 rounds total, meaning every shot has to count. This would not be an effective primary, but as a brutal support piece to the team.

It would need a sprite made. 


Logic:

For those who do not love big bores to an autistic degree, 20mm is considered the boundary between a rifle and autocannon round, as well as defining what the upper limit of what a man-portable rifle is (see the American Anzio 20mm). Recoiless rifles are a strange subsection of firearms, and experimental, fitting the sci-fi gun. Short recoil-operated action is common in autocannons and might be used for a modern recoilless 20mm like this. Semi-auto large caliber snipers are objectively badass.


Picture for scale for 20mm



Item Name:
### Terminator
Description:

Officially referred to as the 8-gauge Contract Termination Device by the EAEA, and often simply called the Terminator. It is a break-action, double-barreled 8-gauge shotgun intended to chamber proprietary 8-gauge depleted uranium buckshot. Each of the two barrels is made to be wide enough that an agent’s thumb could fit comfortably inside the bore.

With a barrel length of 12 inches, the Terminator was envisioned as the EAEA’s solution for close-quarters combat, acting as a breaching, anti-personnel, and even anti-exosuit weapon. Although never seeing mass production due to the extreme expense of the platform and the proprietary nature of its ammunition, the Terminator is occasionally fielded by CBURN ERT.

Implantation: 

The Terminator is also unique, but does not require from-scratch creation. The idea would be to take the Double Barrel, clone it, then change the text, ammo whitelist, etc. 

What it fires would be a fusion of uranium buckshot and slugs. This is to say the spray and the number of projectiles of buckshot, but each projectile is actually a slug, and has the damage and range as such. 

Logic:

The uninformed might misconstrue 8-gauge shells as being like a 12-gauge shell. This is utterly mistaken. 8-gauge in a modern context is a ludicrously large gauge, being restricted to industrial guns like the Remington MasterBlaster. No sane man in the modern age has dared to create such a monster. 

The EAEA, however, has a job to do, and 8-gauge depleted uranium buckshot would turn defunct employees into mulch, as well as virtually any inorganic material into dust.


A Remington MasterBlaster. It is basically a suppressed 100-pound shotgun for turning rocks into sand.


Existing Item Description Changes

Item Name:
### Pulse Rifle
Description:

An experimental, custom-built version of the laser rifle made in-house by the EAEA for use by ART agents, the Pulse Rifle is modified with a highly efficient internal battery and utilizes advanced photon diffusion to magnify a four-watt discharge into a lethal range. The Pulse Rifle provides unmatched capacity, yet still requires external rechargers.


Item Name:
### Pulse Pistol
Description:

A sized-down ART Pulse Rifle, compressing the rifle into a minuscule package with minimal sacrifice to stopping power, at the cost of a proportional reduction in capacity.





Would be needed for hardsuit and other gear as well, albeit with less lore. 



## Roundflow & Player interaction

The goal of this rework is to make a rare ERT admeme spawn more streamlined, flavorful in lore, and terrifying to face. Only a tiny portion of overall rounds will ever see EAEA ERT, with even less seeing ART, and only on admin prompting. Ideally, this PR would make it much more fun for the ART agents who get to pick a busted, unique item, promote teamwork as each special gun has a dedicated role, and also be more fun to die to as crew!

Later, I would want to continue this project into each ERT section to get some love, and automate the round-end for ART so admins don’t have to prompt it!


## Administrative & Server Rule Impact

This is a very admin-focused update, as ART would be a admin only spawn. This would only be breathing more life into an existing idea, beyond the meta-sheld changes to better outline the role of ART and EAEA.

Technical Considerations
I outline the technical practicality of each new item in the item! Beyond that, no foreseen issues!
