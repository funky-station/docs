## Section I. Corporate Secrets

As one of our field officers, you are primarily in charge of maintaining the wellbeing of the station's crew and ensuring that the crew properly performs their job. 
You are to ensure that the crew is kept in line and focused on this task, and you are also to ensure the crew's safety from any external forces. 
These forces may range from xenofauna, such as: snakes, spiders, or slimes, or other corporations, factions or individuals who may want to cause harm to Nanotrasen or its crew. 

One of the primary organizations who may target the station is the Syndicate. The crew is aware that they exist, however, they are instructed that Nanotrasen will take care of any potential issues with it.
You, as one of our officers, are the force that deals with any targetted attacks. The crew should not be involved in any capacity. Similarly, the crew is not to know that their immediate wellbeing is in danger, in the event of Syndicate espionage.
In the event of a targetted attack, you should resolve it to the best of your ability without fearmongering within the crew. 

The crew may be discontent with their current working conditions. You are, of course, to ensure that the cause of this disatisfaciton is not due to unsafe conditions. 
However, this dissatisfaction become unmanagable and cause the crew to consider a unionization, or even a revolt. 
In this event, the source of said discontent is likely caused by an outside force and can not be resolved through de-escalation. Refer to your command members for more instruction. 

You may come across specific items or events that are unexplainable by natural means. These items may be magical in nature. Refer to your command members for more instruction.
