## Overview

Adds in [Conspirators](https://wiki.ss13.co/Conspirator) to Funky, roleplay focused team antagonists ported from Goonstation 13. They are intended to bring a more RP-focused conflict into the shifts that they're present, either by infiltrating specific departments, attempting to convince the station of one inane thing, or by otherwise impacting the overall flow of the round in a silly yet disruptful way.

## Background

As Funkystation currently is, there is a significant lack of RP antagonists to tie into the roleplay that MRP implies. With the addition of pinktext, there are definitely more incentives for existing antagonists to RP and be creative with their objectives - thieves are especially subject to this - but there is a lack of antags where the focus is RP. Especially so for team antagonists.

Adding conspirators and a gamemode focused around them intends to adress this issue. While criticisms of Goon's conspirators seem to pin down a lack of tools, direction, and end reward for them, chances are that these issues may be reduced with the different server culture of Funky and SS14 as a whole.

## Features to be added

### Conspirator Headset Key

#### Implementation

Adds in a secretive key that can be slotted into any headset regardless of how many keys are in it. Must be removed by a pair of wirecutters and doesn't show up on inspect. Speaking through it masks your voice to a random and persistent yet silly, name, and the headset should ideally whisper out any activity on the conspirator's (not so) secret channel if not on an ear slot. Should broadcast over the same frequency that handheld radios use, ideally.

#### Rationale

Gives conspirators a dedicated tool for conspiring without it being something that would be impossible to play around. Contributes to the insidious feeling that they have, where you might turn on a handheld radio and hear only anonymous voices conspire to do... what exactly? Will you keep listening? Would ideally discourage conspirators from yelling their names over not that secure comms and would hopefully add some interesting RP opportunities.

### Conspirator's Robes

Highly compact and hideable robes that mask the user's identity and voice to be the one that the headset uses. May or may not even change the user's ID while equipped.

## Game Design Rationale

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?

# Technical Considerations

- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
