## Overview

This doc is a proposal for a species to replace one of the species that are being axed for the rebase project in an attempt to have a species that is not fuslop. It will be a new species, called the Negef’Mau, that is a strong species with mechanics revolving around their blinders and poor health.



## Background

There are many species in the game that do not provide major gameplay changes besides the size of the species. Called “furslop” these species are going to be consolidated into subspecies and phased out. To help maintain the species variety, this doc is among the few to suggest replacements.





## Features to be added

Negef’Mau are large and ugly creatures that resemble Feline species from Earth. They have very strong senses that can trigger strong physiological and hormonal reactions, especially in a space station. Of all the species, Negef’Mau were the closest to self-annihilation via bioweapons. This cocktail of bioweapons, rushed cures, and partially successful super soldier programs has made the Negef’Mau. Many have tried to undo these effects, but most of the research was destroyed before the long-term effects were discovered.



Negef’Mau are incredible high energy beings. They have a secondary stamina bar called the hyperactivity bar. Unlike the stamine, it does not fill to the full after being stunned and fills more slowly. However, as the hyperactivity bar fills, Negef’Mau will become more jittery and hyperactive. If it fills fully, they will begin to attack their surroundings. To help suppress this unbound energy, the Negef’Mau wear masks to the limits of their strong senses, including hearing, smells and sight, and it is considered a safety precaution to wear one at all times. Negef’Mau without a Blinders are to be assumed to be a danger to those around them. However, some triggers can still cause hyperactivity, like seeing another unmasked Negef’Mau.



**Negef’Mau's body** - an extra 25 hp of softcrit (100-175), but that takes additional genetic damage when crit. Additionally, poison damage does extra genetic damage, and they take increased genetic damage.



**Negef’Mau's eyes** - allow for them to see farther than standard and nightvision. Nullified by the blinder.



**Negef’Mau Lungs** - greater effects when breathing certain toxic gases (pending med stuff).



**Negef’Mau Liver** - genetic, tox, and RAD medicine has less of an effect. Pax is toxic but does not pacify.  


**Negef’Mau Death** - Unlike other species, Negef’Mau rot quickly and release sweet-smelling toxic fumes.



**Negef’Mau Blood** - Negef’Mau is toxic to the touch, dealing a small amount of tox damage to non-Negef’Mau.



**hyperactivity** - Acts as a second stamina bar for Negef’Mau. It does not fill to full immediately after a stun, but fills slowly over time. At 50% fullest, the Negef’Mau will begin to jitter and after sometime be completed to violence. At 75%, the Negef’Mau will have trouble holding onto items and have a shorter time between compulsions. At 100%, the Negef’Mau will not be able to hold items and will constantly be compelled to attack. To avoid harm to crew and themself, Negef’Mau wears blinder that dull their senses to prevent hyperactivity.

Even while wearing a blindfold, the following can cause hyperactivity: seeing unblinded Mau, eating meat, seeing pest mobs, THC (Catnip), and seeing clowns.



**Negef’Mau Claws** - deal 5 slash, increase to 15 with a full hyperactivity bar.



#### Other stuff for far in the future.

**Negef’Mau ears** - lets you hear from further away. Nullified by blinders

Custom blinder in character creator

New sprites, markings, and hair



## Game Design Rationale



### Seriously Silly

They are giant hyperactive cats. When they gain hyperactivity, they have to find a way to burn that energy. Despite being hulking biohazards, that as testaments to not playing god, they are still big ol cats.



### Maximizing Roleplay Potential

Much like how Vox players have their characters decide whether or not they like their masks, blinders can be a similar debate. This is especially true because the blinders nullify some of the benefits. It adds a discussion on when it is appropriate for a Negef’Mua to unmask. They are unlike any other species, which can cause friction.



## Roundflow \& Player interaction

Unblinded Negef’Mua pose a unique challenge for sec due to their extra stamina, which makes them harder to disable and deadly at close range. Sec must determine how they want to approach. When harm does come to a Mua, they pose a biohazard to the medical team, while being harder to treat for non-combat-related damage.



## Administrative \& Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

Much like how people use thaven to self-antag, I can see this being a problem with the Negef’Mua. Hyperactivity can force them to cause harm to something, but there are plenty of ways to manage it. If a player refuses to manage their hyperactivity in a way that does harm the crew, they may be banned for NIRP.



## Technical Considerations.

Some components of the stamina system may have to be altered to have this function properly. While it will be easy, changes to Crit and how some damage is calculated might also be necessary. I do not think this will cause any more lag than other species.
