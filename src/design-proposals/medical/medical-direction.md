## Overview

This is meant to be a guiding document for the entirety of the medical system and department. These can overall be summarized into design principles, however, some outlining systems are included. The principles themselves take precedence over any example systems listed in this document, as it is meant to be a guiding direction rather than a strict timeline. If you have any questions about this document, feel free to discuss them in the medical workgroup or contact @correspond on Discord directly.

## Design Principles

### I. Suspend Your Disbelief (in the Name of Slapstick)

Above all else, the primary principle to consider for medical is the *aesthetic* of it. The why or how we get there don't actually matter that much, the primary goal is that there is a story to be told through the game. When players get hurt, they should get hurt. Simple as that. But the ways we flavor this depend on the primary goal of each fork.

For us, Funky Station, we're looking for a world that takes itself serious, even in the face of silly interactions. The best way to do this is to create a system that represents real biology just enough to push it into the suspension of disbelief; by backing these situations with science, we can push them to contemplate even the fantastical.

Similarly, though, the systems that we are basing this world off of are interesting! Okay, sadly, I am not a STEM major or doctor or anything. But genuinely, biology and all of its subdisciplines are really interesting and seeking to emulate those very interesting parts is a primary goal of the system. The aesthetic we are seeking, on top of this seriously-silly slapstick, is a genuine interest and passion for the systems being created.

For example: An assistant comes into medical after being half turned into a green goop slime. The MDs have no idea what's going on, though they're able to treat the surface level of cleaning up burns, administering painkillers, replacing completely gooped limbs, etc. The assistant can leave at this point, though slightly goopy, and be fine. But if someone wants, they can also dig deeper: A space-borne virus has caused their immune cells to go haywire and attack and replace their own tissues with green goop. Effectively, the player develops a mid-round autoimmune disorder that can be treated by transplanting them into a new, slimy body.

### II. Respect Player Autonomy

The medical system, as a whole, will impact every single player regardless of how much they want to interact with it. Because of this, the system should be divided into two layers: simplified, and complex. The average player should only be required to interact with a simplified surface layer of the medical system. Injuries should generally be kept to simplified aspects: cuts cause slash wounds, and can be bandaged up to stop bleeding. Things like potential infections should be kept to the complex layer of the system, a layer that only the medical *department* should be required to interact with.

These systems, if grounded in reality, are pretty complex systems and knowledge that not everyone has access to. Similarly, as we abstract and simplify these systems to be in a video game, then there's a disconnect between that knowledge and knowledge of the game itself. Relying on people to be able to interact with these systems at all, without the safety net of in-game training, will likely just cause people to become frustrated with the entirety of the system as a whole.

### III. Represent What You Can

should be grounded in reality and represent those who cant

### IV. Let Things Progress Naturally

nothing should feel forced

### V. Above All, Have Fun

these should be *interesting* systems that are fun
