## Overview

This is meant to be a guiding document for the entirety of the medical system and department. These can overall be summarized into design principles, however, some outlining systems are included. The principles themselves take precedence over any example systems listed in this document, as it is meant to be a guiding direction rather than a strict timeline. If you have any questions about this document, feel free to discuss them in the medical workgroup or contact @correspond on Discord directly.

## Design Principles

### I. Suspend Your Disbelief (in the Name of Slapstick)

Above all else, the primary principle to consider for medical is the *aesthetic* of it. The why or how we get there don't actually matter that much, the primary goal is that there is a story to be told through the game. When players get hurt, they should get hurt. Simple as that. But the ways we flavor this depend on the primary goal of each fork.

For us, Funky Station, we're looking for a world that takes itself serious, even in the face of silly interactions. The best way to do this is to create a system that represents real biology just enough to push it into the suspension of disbelief; by backing these situations with science, we can push them to contemplate even the fantastical.

Similarly, though, the systems that we are basing this world off of are interesting! Okay, sadly, I am not a STEM major or doctor or anything. But genuinely, biology and all of its subdisciplines are really interesting and seeking to emulate those very interesting parts is a primary goal of the system. The aesthetic we are seeking, on top of this seriously-silly slapstick, is a genuine interest and passion for the systems being created.

For example: An assistant comes into medical after being half turned into a green goop slime. The MDs have no idea what's going on, though they're able to treat the surface level of cleaning up burns, administering painkillers, replacing completely gooped limbs, etc. The assistant can leave at this point, though slightly goopy, and be fine. But if someone wants, they can also dig deeper: A space-borne virus has caused their immune cells to go haywire and attack and replace their own tissues with green goop. Effectively, the player develops a mid-round autoimmune disorder that can be treated by transplanting them into a new, slimy body.

### II. Respect Player Autonomy

The medical system, as a whole, will impact every single player regardless of how much they want to interact with it. Because of this, the system should be divided into two layers: simplified, and complex. The average player should only be required to interact with a simplified surface layer of the medical system. Injuries should generally be kept to simplified aspects: cuts cause slash wounds, and can be bandaged up to stop bleeding. Things like potential infections should be kept to the complex layer of the system, a layer that only the medical *department* should be required to interact with.

These systems, if grounded in reality, are pretty complex systems and knowledge that not everyone has access to. Similarly, as we abstract and simplify these systems to be in a video game, then there's a disconnect between that knowledge and knowledge of the game itself. Relying on people to be able to interact with these systems at all, without the safety net of in-game training, will likely just cause people to become frustrated with the entirety of the system as a whole.

Another thing to keep in mind with this is how we communicate systems to players. There will be a  disconnect between the game and the player, so with certain systems, we have to keep in mind how game information is communicated to the player. For example, moodlets and pain are not things that can easily be communicated to the player (because the player is not their character). Expecting players to adhere to and even recognize abstract things like emotions through their character does not respect their autonomy.

### III. Represent What You Can, Respect What You Can't

By attempting to simulate real biology, we are also simulating medical problems that people face in their lives. Not everything will be the same as it is in real life, but there will still be parallels regardless of if we try to move away from that. Instead, it is better for us to embrace this representation. People may be chronically ill, and maybe they want their characters to represent them and their medical issues. This is fine, and we should strive to represent this! This is especially true because we, inadvertently, can help bring more understanding to how these medical problems work to people who may not be directly impacted by them. 

However, the flip side is true: we can't represent everything with the accuracy that these issues may require. From this, we should still be respectful of the fact that chronic medical issues do impact many people, regardless of if we personally know about that particular medical issue or anyone impacted by it. 

### IV. Let Things Progress Naturally

Again, the primary goal is to tell a story from these systems. With the medical system in particular, it is important to remember that this story should have a natural, emergent progression. This is particularly important when deciding things like chronic illnesses or blood types--people should not have to deal with the exact same issues, at the exact same time, every single shift. The game is ultimately about improv, and when creating  systems that can be persistent, it is still important to make sure that they allow for emergent storytelling.

For example, in the case of blood types (a system we are likely not implementing regardless): assuming blood is cross-compatible between species, should the types be a persistent player trait or randomized every shift? Both have their pros and cons, it's kind of silly for players to need to check their own blood type every shift instead of just being able to know that. However, letting it be a trait also creates the issue where it promotes players memorizing other players blood types, instead creating a stagnant story. 

### V. Above All, Have Fun

Ultimately, these should be fun systems! This is especially important to remember when we seek to emulate real biology, memorizing chemical structures or enzymes or proteins is not that fun for everyone. Spending the entire shift completely rotted because of a small mistake or misunderstanding is not that fun. Spending 30 minutes in crit because you can't be revived just yet, but also can't ghost out because you're almost up, is not that fun. We want a fun and interesting system!
