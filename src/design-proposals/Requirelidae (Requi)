## Overview

This doc adds the Reqirelidae, a polecat-like species that has a quick circadian rhythm.

## Background

With many species being consuladated, the opening for new species has begun with many people wanting more mechanical depth and interesting species. 

## Features to be added

### Requirelidae (Requir)

ruh·kwai·luh·dai

#### Lore:

The Requir are genetically related to the original species on their home planet of I.D.K-19293 before genetic programs and bioweapons fractured the species. Originally, they came from neutral countries or factions that hid away from the horrors in bunkers, making them slimmer and smaller to save space and only leaving to hunt. This genetic alteration was further pushed when the Requir was forced to expand into ark stations early in the civilizations live. However, these are ill-prepared and primitive required constant maintenance and monitoring, leading to the Requir ability to take micro naps and never truly sleeping.  Despite their distance from the conflict, the bioweapons still had a profound effect on their mutation process, but have made them very sickly when compared to their more exposed counterparts.  

#### 

#### Appearance:

The Requir have long, lanky bodies and short, stubby limbs. They closely resemble the polecats of Earth. There are a few common skin conditions from bioweapons, RMB (Requirelidae Mange Balding), which can cause full hairlessness, and FFWD (Requirelidae Facial Wart Disease), which causes bumps to form on the face.

#### General Stats:

Purely carnivorous, they cannot digest plant matter without becoming sick.   
Claws do slash instead of brunt  
Has an increased metabolism, requiring more food.   
Can crawl at the same speed that they move.  
Have a natural but weaker version of night vision. 

#### Main Gimmick:

**Circadian Gland** \-  Alternates between two states:  
Active \- works and moves faster, is jittery.

* Is speedup by being in light areas, eating  

Dormant- works and moves more slowly, compulsive yawning

* Is speedup by being in the dark, seeing pests, and being hungry.

**Adrenal Glands** \- Forces a more powerful version of the Active stage, no matter what state they are in. Once it ends, they will be forced into an equally powerful dormant state.   
Active \- works and moves faster, is jittery and clumsy.   
Dormant \- Slows them down and makes them narcoleptic. 

THC decreases rapidly. 

The rate at which these can change can be influenced by a trait.   
Additionally, when viro gets added, I want them to be highly susceptible to disease and take extra tox damage.

## Game Design Rationale

### Seriously Silly

The constand damramic switches between zooming around and to lazying around make for a perfect silly species. They’re Circadian Gland makes them have to can be the source of many comedic failures. 

## Roundflow & Player interaction

While the species will have its moments of greatness while it's zooming around, it also allows for a lot of downtime. The constant switching between zipping around and low battery mode will allow for many goofy moments.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

## Technical Considerations

Setting up the states so that they can override each other might be a problem.  
The biggest concern is setting up systems to speed up of the states.
