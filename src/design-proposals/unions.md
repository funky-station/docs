# Department Unions

| Designers | Implemented | GitHub Links |

| taydeo | :x: No | TBD |

## Overview

The Stations Departments will each have a union, excluding Command. This includes security as well.

A player can opt in to be chosen as a head of a union for their department. Selection is random, and if no one is selected as a union leader, another player will be chosen to lead both unions, or multiple.

This will ultimately replace the Revolutionaries gamemode, and server rules will adjust as well. SOP will also be adjusted to be a LOT more sensical and immediately relavent to shift needs. This is to ensure that union heads and enforcers convince other members to follow their SOP, otherwise pay or other station benefits will be lost.

All station unions will have a mix of benefits already provided, such as improved healthcare plans, increased scrip pay, or other benefits, such as a free drink every 15 minutes. The Head of Personnel, NTR or Captain can increase or remove benefits.

This isn't a separate gamemode, this is just Space Station now.

## Background

There is a huge gap in this game. How do players express discontent with command staff in a way that is tangible and round changing? Revolutionaries as a secret gamemode only present a window into an overarching story of corporate slavery and exploitation. As Funky Station wants to be a more immersive MRP environment, its best that we introduce dynamics that exist in real life.

Revolutionaries will be removed in favor of this.

## Features to be added

### Union Leader

A union leader is a randomly selected player (who opts in) to lead their department union. They are given special tools and items. They can roll changeling, traitor, thief, pretty much all round start antagonists. They are not mindshielded.

These special tools are,
* Whistle
* Megaphone
* Union Leader Hardhat (department themed!)
* 2 Steward Caps
* Clipboard Roster
* Brass Knuckles

These are used to rally and organize employees on the station. A union leaders job is to ensure that both your employees are following their contracts (SOP) and that Command is treating employees fairly.

The Security Union is given additional leeway, such as protection when an arrest goes wrong, funding for lawyers if a case ever makes it to trial, other union members serving to intimidate passengers or victims of crime (Other unions can do this as well!), and give out bribes to command, crew members, or other roleplay scenarios that would make something interesting.

Union Leaders can request funds be taken out of their departments budget, as a stand in until scrip is properly implemented. It is up to them how these funds are used.

### Whistle

Standard whistle. Used to alert people to Get Moving or Stop Moving.

### Megaphone

This is an item that allows a union leader to call a strike. After a strike is called, union members are expected to stop working. Union Members who see Non-Striking Union Members are encouraged to take extra measures to ensure that they do not work. The same goes for non-union members or passsengers/other various personnel that were not originally part of a department who begin working for a department. Making this an innate feature (such as Thieving on Thieves) is an idea I am open to, but a megaphone is undeniably cool.

The item will work like a toggle. When it is initially activated, a station announcement will play, announcing that the Union is on strike. Characters are free to react however they want to this, but they also understand that pay is supsended, things like department consoles that are used for work are closed, shuttles, such as the salvage shuttle, are to be returned to the station ASAP, whatever else that can be thought of.

When the item is used a second time, the strike is called off. There is a 15 minute delay between uses. 

If a person who is NOT a union leader tries to use the item, they will be given a prompt asking them if they would like to become the union head. Ideally, this won't be abused. That's what the brass knuckles are for.

### Union Leader Hardhat

It's to signify that this character is in-fact a union leader. They are to wear this if they want to be taken seriously, but there is no need.

### Steward Cap

The Steward Cap is given to those who the Union Leader deems capable of enforcing SOP and also attending to the needs of workers. A worker may complain to either the Union Leader or Steward that they are being mistreated, that another department is slacking, report missing personnel, etcetera. The Union Leader must tap their ID to their clipboard, and register them as the Steward.

### Clipboard Roster

A clipboard that can register new members to the union. Simply tap their ID, enter some additional information, and they now appear on the roster. They are now elgible to become a steward or the union leader. To remove someone from the union, you can click X. They get a NanoChat or some other notification alerting them that they have been removed. Roleplay can go from there (don't expect to be alive if you do this).

### Brass Knuckles

Sometimes words aren't enough.

### Win Condition

Since this is replacing revolutionaries, this is important to mention.

There is no win-condition.

People who are on strike or willingly break their contracts, or those who do NOT have contracts are not allowed on the evacuation shuttle. If a riot or strike gets so terrible, command is free to use lethal force to escape, and protect loyal crew and station property. A contract can be broken by the worker themselves or a command member. A Union Steward can recommend that someones contract be broken, for fighting, not following SOP, endangering others, or otherwise any issue that is deemed relavent. 

There will be no evac restrictions apart from those imposed by other antagonists. A new Space Law provision can be added to prevent strikers from accessing CC, allowing security to forcefully remove or kill strikers and union heads. Encourage strikers to stay on the station with some fancy green text talking about how the station was overrun by strikers and revolutionaries.

## Game Design Rationale

Setting is the most important thing in Space Station. Building up this setting to its maximum potential allows players to sink their teeth into a rich world where things Happen:tm:. This Happening:tm: will encourage players to interact with one another in a way that makes sense for roleplay.

There is nothing magical here in terms of mechanics, but the primary goal is to continue building up our world to encourage corruption and violence, in a way that does not feel out of nowhere.

## Roundflow & Player interaction

This is the biggest change to roundflow that has ever happened on Funky.

All rounds from now on will have this looming precense of tangible violence that can break out at any time if someone fucks up big enough. Players will be forced to consider what their actions will mean in the long run (in the context of a round), both in terms of what there is to gain and potential consequences. Laws will also have to be rewritten to make sure that they do side with NanoTrasen, but also leave there be enough meat for potential court cases and decisions to be made by higher ups in NanoTrasen. The Magistrate and all other roles will now have an extended responsibility to make sure that they protect all NanoTrasen property. 

Union Stewards will also now make sure their departments have everything they need to keep running. This is the contract between the Union, employees, and NanoTrasen. That they will fulfill the stipulations of the contract to the best of their ability.

More and more people will be accountable to each-other, which for an immersive roleplaying game, is a good thing.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

This will change a lot of things. The removal of the self-antag rule and an emphasis on keeping things in-character is now paramount. There needs to be a greater emphasis on each player that they will keep things that happens in a round confined to a round, and to accept that things will not always go their way, if ever. 

Why this prelude? The game, after this is merged, more than ever is now dependent on things running smoothly between departments and between individuals. If a break down in communication happens, that is heard. If materials are now running out, that is heard. Conflicts that does not relate directly with antagonists will be more common now. This is ultimately our goal, to blur that distinction in-character as much as possible to allow people to tell interesting and immersive stories.

# Technical Considerations

not much really other than revs being removed. we can keep all that logic the same.
