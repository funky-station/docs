# Department Unions

## Overview

The Stations Departments will each have a union, excluding Command. This includes security as well.

A player can opt in to be chosen as a head of a union for their department. Selection is random, and if no one is selected as a union leader, another player will be chosen to lead both unions, or multiple.

This will ultimately replace the Revolutionaries gamemode, and server rules will adjust as well. SOP will also be adjusted to be a LOT more sensical and immediately relavent to shift needs. This is to ensure that union heads and enforcers convince other members to follow their SOP, otherwise pay or other station benefits will be lost.

All station unions will have a mix of benefits already provided, such as improved healthcare plans, increased scrip pay, or other benefits, such as a free drink every 15 minutes. The Head of Personnel, NTR or Captain can increase or remove benefits.

## Background

There is a huge gap in this game. How do players express discontent with command staff in a way that is tangible and round changing? Revolutionaries as a secret gamemode only present a window into an overarching story of corporate slavery and exploitation. As Funky Station wants to be a more immersive MRP environment, its best that we introduce dynamics that exist in real life.

Revolutionaries will be removed in favor of this.

## Features to be added

### Union Leader

A union leader is a randomly selected player (who opts in) to lead their department union. They are given special tools and items. They can roll changeling, traitor, thief, pretty much all round start antagonists. They are not mindshielded.

These special tools are,
* Whistle
* Megaphone
* Union Leader Hardhat (department themed!)
* 2 Steward Caps
* Clipboard Roster
* Brass Knuckles

These are used to rally and organize employees on the station. A union leaders job is to ensure that both your employees are following their contracts (SOP) and that Command is treating employees fairly.

The Security Union is given additional leeway, such as protection when an arrest goes wrong, funding for lawyers if a case ever makes it to trial, other union members serving to intimidate passengers or victims of crime (Other unions can do this as well!), and give out bribes to command, crew members, or other roleplay scenarios that would make something interesting.

Union Leaders can request funds be taken out of their departments budget, as a stand in until scrip is properly implemented. It is up to them how these funds are used.

### Whistle

Standard whistle. Used to alert people to Get Moving or Stop Moving.

### Megaphone

This is an item that allows a union leader to call a strike. After a strike is called, union members are expected to stop working. Union Members who see Non-Striking Union Members are encouraged to take extra measures to ensure that they do not work. The same goes for non-union members or passsengers/other various personnel that were not originally part of a department who begin working for a department. Making this an innate feature (such as Thieving on Thieves) is an idea I am open to, but a megaphone is undeniably cool.

The item will work like a toggle. When it is initially activated, a station announcement will play, announcing that the Union is on strike. Characters are free to react however they want to this, but they also understand that pay is supsended, things like department consoles that are used for work are closed, shuttles, such as the salvage shuttle, are to be returned to the station ASAP, whatever else that can be thought of.

When the item is used a second time, the strike is called off. There is a 15 minute delay between uses. 

If a person who is NOT a union leader tries to use the item, they will be given a prompt asking them if they would like to become the union head. Ideally, this won't be abused. That's what the brass knuckles are for.

### Union Leader Hardhat

It's to signify that this character is in-fact a union leader. They are to wear this if they want to be taken seriously, but there is no need.

### Steward Cap

The Steward Cap is given to those who the Union Leader deems capable of enforcing SOP and also attending to the needs of workers. A worker may complain to either the Union Leader or Steward that they are being mistreated, that another department is slacking, report missing personnel, etcetera. The Union Leader must tap their ID to their clipboard, and register them as the Steward.

### Clipboard Roster

A clipboard that can register new members to the union. Simply tap their ID, enter some additional information, and they now appear on the roster. They are now elgible to become a steward or the union leader. To remove someone from the union, you can click X. They get a NanoChat or some other notification alerting them that they have been removed. Roleplay can go from there (don't expect to be alive if you do this).

### Brass Knuckles

Sometimes words aren't enough.
