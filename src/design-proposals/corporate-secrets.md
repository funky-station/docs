## Overview

The metashield, as it currently is, is confusing and heavily relies on OOC enforcement of IC actions. This is a proposal in order to rewrite the metashield as "corporate secrets," focusing on giving players a better way to react to the game in character. 

The basic summary of corporate secrets is:
- Pretty much everything is shielded now, with some minor exceptions. Normal crewmates are here to do their job, and as such, NT does not tell them about any of the potential on-station threats.
- However, command *is* trained to deal with these threats. The metashield does not exist for them. However, these threats are *corporate secrets,* and command has signed some sort of NDA about them. Telling the crew about said threats (unless in emergency situations) is strictly prohibited. 
- Since IAA, NTR and the Magistrate are directly from NT corporate, they are tasked with ensuring that command does not fearmonger and spill the secrets. In the case that a command member reveals corporate secrets unnecessarily, these three would be the ones to punish them IC. Admins are still encouraged to enforce the metashield OOC. 
- The metashield can only be lifted one of two ways: Central Command announcements (think war ops, unusual activity, or blob biohazard announcements) or by command telling the crew.
