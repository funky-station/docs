## Overview  
This suggests a new antagonist, Hitman. A kill objective only antag with a roulette of clients and kits.

## game design reasoning  
Within the syndicate roles none of them purely have kill objectives. This makes playing a hitman and like very hard since it requires a kill objective to exist and be something that is hard to do.   
By adding a role for kill objectives, it opens up this niche of roleplay. The factions add to this and make this different gameplay-wise from just kill only the syndicate. As well as make for more variance among rounds

## addtions   
major  
One: Hitman as a antag  
Minor  
One: small organ container, a small container for organs which keeps them fresh. For use in interdyne objectives. Can easily not be easily added  
Two: special interaction with a sacfial dagger to carve a rune into the person. Is noted when examining the person and goes away from healing. For use in cult objectives.  
three: camera bug app downloader. This is a item which you put in a pda to get a camer bug app. This app will allow the given person to see stuff as if they had a camera bug. This is simply to make it take less space and make it slightly more concealable. This can easily be replaced with a camera bug.  
four: false ninja boots, a variant of ninja boots that aren't no-slips,only give a \+25% speed increase(5% less) and are visually noisy . This is to make using them liable to get you spotted/arrested. Basically just a version of ninja boots for someone who isnt an antag on sight and thusly wearing them all the time shouldnt be happening.  
five: 1 use teleport scroll. Exactly what its name is. Weaker variant for hitmen  
six: \[random\] heretic dagger. A weaker variant of the heretic blade with variants per the different paths.   
seven: manus gloves. A weaker version of manus grasp tied to gloves since a hitman would not know the spell.  

## my design for a hitman antag  
Antagonist suggestion: hitman   
Spawn rules: similar to thief or similar to traitor  
Objectives: 0-1 kill x target objective/ 0-2 teach a leason to x target objectives, (max of two kill objectives, min of 1)/ reach cc unrestrained and alive.

Factions: every hitman is hired by a faction. They grant one new kit and may grant a special objective.

Faction objectives: (all \[x\] objectives are targets you already have a objective for unless noted)  
Syndicate: drop a syndicate business card at the scene of the crime(untracked)/ Teach a lesson to anybody on the station(in addition to all other objectives)  
Gorlax marauders:(higher chance for kill objectives) make \[x\]’s death brutal(untracked)/ bring some of the items on \[x\]s body to cc(untracked).  
Cyber sun: ensure \[x\]’s silicon body is destroyed(replaces teach a lesson objective for someone else(ai is treated the same as captain objective selection-wise)/ Make \[x\]’s death look like an accident(untracked)  
Bonkco: bring \[x\] cut of meat from \[x\] station pet is brought to cc(replaces teach a lesson objective you already have)/make \[x\] targets death clean(untracked)  
Interdyne:(more likely to have teach a lesson objectives) bring one of \[x\] targets vital organs back to cc fresh( given container and surgical tools on demand)/bring one of \[x\]’s limbs to cc fresh(given container and surgical tools on demand)  
Spider clan:(slightly higher chance to be science department for targets)bring some of the items on \[x\]s body to cc(untracked)/kill someone in a public space(replaces a teach a lesson objective)  
Revolutionaries:(high chance to be a head) kill \[x\] in an overt way(untracked)/ ensure the station knows abouts \[x\]’s death.  
Wizard federation:(lower chance for low rank nt to be targets) announce to everyone \[x\] targets to be killed before doing it(untracked)/be theatrical with \[X\] target's death.(untracked)  
Manus cult: carve a rune onto the \[x\] target after death(given dagger)/ record the targets actions before death and reaction to death(give paper)(untracked)  
Blood cult: carve a rune onto the \[x\] target after death(given dagger)/make \[x\] target’s death messy(untracked)  
Affluent client:(high chance for only 1 kill target. Higher chance to have multiple modifier objectives) ensure \[x\]’s death is painful/ make \[x\]’s death is theartical/make \[x\]’s death clean/ make \[x\]’s death theartical/ make \[x\]’s death look like an accident/ bring some of the items on \[x\] body to cc(untracked)  
Criminal client:(lower chance for high value targets. higher chance for multiple modifiers) kill someone close to \[x\](any death greentexts)/put a calling card at the scene of the crime(untracked)/ ensure the station knows about the target's death(untracked)/ make \[x\]’s death messy(untracked)/ make \[x\]’s death is painful(untracked)/ bring some of the items on \[x\]’s body to cc(untracked)  
Nanotrasen:(low chance of non-antags being targets, low chance of this faction being selected, ensures more antags can spawn) ensure \[x\]’s death seems like and acident(untracked)/ensure \[antagonist name\] on the station is killed, they have \[feature mutiple players have\]

## roundflow interaction   
This would basically act the same in a round as a kill only syndicate but how they do it would change due to the modifiers.  
Basically, it would interact close to normal killer antagonists but with more variety in how exactly they are killed from round to round. For the antagonistic players, it allows for games with more creative kill objective rounds. That is about all  
## administrative impact  
There should not be much but this antagonist existing may mean more kills and thusly more malding. Alongside this it will have to be kept in mind there is a hitman possibly in the game and how they work. Overall should not be that much though.  
## technical considerations  
The faction system and its objectives should
