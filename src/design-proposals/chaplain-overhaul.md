# Chaplain role overhaul

## Forewarning
These changes are unlikely to happen anytime soon, so please make balancing suggestions with that in mind. As of right now, I am planning on rebalancing the gauntlet and all the other nullrods. With the increase in effective "chaplains", I will also obviously make stuff like closing rifts take much longer and potentially damaging to the acolytes. Number discussions are welcome, but I don't want that to be the predominant discussion until the ideas are set in stone.

## Overview
This document will propose several ideas I've been thinking up for quite some time regarding the chaplain's role on the station, but the key points are:

• Chaplain will become an authority on magic/the occult, similar to the magister, with one predominant role: enforcing what magic is legal/considered evil and what religion is sanctioned aboard the station.
The reason for this being that there currently isn't an authority on magics as of the removal of EOC and navigating magic use in general has been confusing for many.

• Similarly to the nullrod, chaplain will - preferably roundstart - select a sect. Sects will be themed around the already existing altars. This sect defines the flavour of whatever religion they decide to practice this shift. 
More details on sects below and will be expanded as I get more ideas/feedback

• Chaplain will have a small group of acolytes, likely 1-3, who follow the chaplain and whatever sect they decide upon. They will be notably less capable than the chaplain, 
but can act as the chaplain's successor in the event of their permanent death or when they cryo/SSD. They will also be vulnerable to cult mind control and other magics that the chaplain is normally impervious to.

• An actual SOP for the chaplains and acolytes to define the role of NanoTrasen's religious sect more clearly.

• Debating whether or not nullrods should be attached to respective sects


## Features to be added
• Various mapping changes to the chapel as a whole to accommodate 1-3 extra acolytes depending on map size and intended population.

• Addition of the acolyte job.

• Addition of chapel and acolyte SOP.

• Sects that define the miracles the chaplain can perform.

• A self-sufficient miracle system, with "spells" defined by your sect.

• A swathe of new bibles to match the new sects, potentially with different familiars and capabilities.

• Crafting for altars in the case that a chaplain wishes to follow a sect that doesn't match the roundstart altar.


## Acolyte
• Requires a PDA. I'll probably resprite the chaplain PDA at the same time as making this one.

## Chaplain and acolyte SOP
WIP

## Sects - WIP
### Fire (red altar)

• Bible: greater healing capability, but burns the healer.

• Miracle(s): ability to spawn magic candles and create firesticks (emergency welding tools that can only be used by chaplains and acolytes but don't hurt eyes)

### Technology (technology altar)

• Bible: loses the ability to heal organics, instead heals silicons

• Miracle(s): VERY expensive ability to convert organics into silicons (likely default look, target has to be willing)

### Greed (NanoTrasen altar)

• Bible: stronger heal, but costs money

• Miracle(s): spawn a random amount of spesos, can convert silver into gold

### Chaos (chaos altar)

• Bible: stronger heal that has a chance of dealing damage instead regardless of a helmet

• Miracle(s): roll the fated die: a d6 with varying negative or positive effects

### Nature (druid altar)

• Bible: standard, but is more effective on animals

• Miracle(s): the ability to spawn trees and astro-grass (because normal grass tiles can't be placed)

### Miracle system
Originally inspired by the /tg/station sects, but I realized the possibility of that becoming very gamey so instead it works as follows:
You have a miracle pool that slowly fills up over the course of the round, performing miracles draws from this pool. Could possibly make use of rituals that requires the presence of acolyte(s) to speed up miracle regeneration

## Technical considerations
• Rebalancing nullrods and the chaplain/acolytes' ability to effectively remove cult rifts

• Reducing the chaplain's individual combat prowess against cultists and heretics

# Game Design rationale

## Seriously silly
These changes would allow for greater roleplay, via the acolytes and a self-sufficient miracle system so chaplains don't have to rely exclusively on prayers anymore for grand sermons. NanoTrasen as a company would want to benefit and control magic use, and I consider the chaplain to be the perfect fit as they typically turn into the authority on the occult during cultist rounds anyway.

## Maintaining Authenticity
With magic no longer explicitly being illegal, I feel like there should be a role that interacts with it in a meaningful way. Currently, it isn't really acknowledged by NanoTrasen at all and there are no structures in place to control or regulate magic in the game, which feels uncharacteristic of a mega-corporation. Introducing a self-regulating miracle system will also help the role of chaplain feel more authentic itself, with the primary focus of miracles being flavour over function. Being able to erect a tree isn't necessarily that useful, but is a beautiful miracle of life and could be used to change the vibe of the chapel significantly.
Developing more identity for each sect will make religion feel more and more authentic within the world.

## Dynamic environment
The chaplain being the local authority on magic will create interesting scenarios where chaplains embrace the magic some antags have to offer - assuming they agree to work for NanoTrasen (Note: it will still be self-antagging to explicitly help cult obviously, you're here to control/eradicate the occult not actively work with it against NanoTrasen's interest). The existence of acolytes creates many new dynamic situations. Their fallibility makes them an interesting role and could be used to cultists' advantage to get close to the chaplain, or create a situation where the acolyte attempts to overtake the chaplain to act as their successor in a bid for more power, etc.
