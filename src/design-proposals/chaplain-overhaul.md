Shoutout to GreyMario for bouncing ideas.

## Forewarning
These changes are unlikely to happen anytime soon, so please make balancing suggestions with that in mind. As of right now, I am planning on rebalancing the gauntlet and all the other nullrods. With the increase in effective "chaplains", I will also obviously make stuff like closing rifts take much longer and potentially damaging to the acolytes. Number discussions are welcome, but I don't want that to be the predominant discussion until the ideas are set in stone.

## Overview
This document will propose several ideas I've been thinking up for quite some time regarding the chaplain's role on the station, but the key points are:

• Chaplain will become an authority on magic/the occult, similar to the magister, with one predominant role: enforcing what magic is legal/considered evil and what religion is sanctioned aboard the station.
The reason for this being that there currently isn't an authority on magics as of the removal of EOC and navigating magic use in general has been confusing for many. They don't know about corporate secrets, they know a heavily skewed and brainwashed account of the occult (cultists, heretics). It is a sort of altered version of corpo secrets that is only relevant to the chaplain and their acolytes.

• Similarly to the nullrod, chaplain will - preferably roundstart - select a sect. Sects will be themed around the already existing altars. This sect defines the flavour of whatever religion they decide to practice this shift. 
More details on sects below and will be expanded as I get more ideas/feedback. Sects define the following: the function of the chaplain's bible, flavour-over-function miracles and limiting nullrod selections to those appropriate for the sect's theme.

• Chaplain will have a small group of acolytes, likely 1-3, who follow the chaplain and whatever sect they decide upon. They will be notably less capable than the chaplain, 
but can act as the chaplain's successor in the event of their permanent death or when they cryo/SSD. They will also be vulnerable to cult mind control and other magics that the chaplain is normally impervious to.

• An actual SOP for the chaplains and acolytes to define the role of NanoTrasen's religious sect more clearly.


## Features to be added
• Various mapping changes to the chapel as a whole to accommodate 1-3 extra acolytes depending on map size and intended population.

• Addition of the acolyte job.

• Addition of chapel and acolyte SOP.

• Sects that define the miracles the chaplain can perform.

• A self-sufficient miracle system, with "spells" defined by your sect.

• A swathe of new bibles to match the new sects, potentially with different familiars and capabilities.

• Crafting for altars in the case that a chaplain wishes to follow a sect that doesn't match the roundstart altar.

• Making holy damage functional.

• Mapping and pietydrobe changes to account for acolytes.

• Mandatory exemptions from working for mass.

## Chaplain and acolyte SOP & Space Law

### Chaplain

### Green alert
1. The chaplain must keep the nullrod in its base form, or otherwise manifest a non-weapon form.

2. The chaplain must prepare a sermon and establish a time of congregation for said sermon. Sermons are expected to last 5 to 10 minutes.

3. The chaplain may not bible thump crew without explicit consent from the thumpee.

4. The chaplain must listen and make time for any and all confessions or otherwise direct an acolyte to handle individual confessions.

### Blue alert
1. The chaplain may manifest any nullrod form, but may not openly carry it if it has been manifested as a weapon.

2. The chaplain must still make preparations for a sermon if one has not yet been held.

3. The chaplain must investigate the legitimacy of any occult-related claims and relay their findings to the relevant authorities: central command or command. General holy duties can be given to acolytes while the chaplain investigates.

4. If unholy activities are confirmed, the chaplain is expected to inform their acolytes under a non-disclosure agreement.
### Red alert

1. The chaplain is only expected to act against threats that are occult in nature, working closely with security until the threat is quelled.

2. The chaplain must comply if any member of command or security requests access to the cremator.

3. The chaplain can, in cases of grievous emergency, bible thump members of crew without their consent assuming they are protected from its harmful elements.

4. The chaplain may use their nullrod and its respective forms in self defence or otherwise in pursuit of their holy duties.

### OOC rules & expectations

1. The chaplain is recommended not to reveal what they know about the occult to crew. In the best of cases, this will result in demotion and in the worst of cases this will result in execution.

2. The chaplain is not a security role and is not expected to pursue people legally or arrest them.

### Acolyte

### Green alert

1. Acolytes are expected to follow the same religion and practices as the chaplain, unless the religion and practices are unsanctioned and/or illegal.

2. Acolytes must help the chaplain prepare for the sermon and participate in it. When the time for a sermon is established and the time draws near, acolytes are expected to gather as many people for the sermon as they can.

3. Acolytes must must listen and make time for any and all confessions when directed or when the chaplain is indisposed.

4. Acolytes may not bible thump crew without explicit consent from the thumpee.

### Blue alert

1. Acolytes are still expected to continue their general holy duties.

### Red alert

1. Acolytes must assist the chaplain and security with possible exorcisms, cleanses, etc. as necessary.

2. Acolytes can, in cases of grievous emergency, bible thump members of crew without their consent assuming they are protected from its harmful elements.

3. Acolytes must comply if any member of command or security requests access to the cremator.

## Space Law

### III degree

### Denial of Spiritual & Religious Service

  [bold]Description[/bold]: To deny an employee the mandated 5-10 minute work exemption for spiritual and religious service through congregation.

  [bold]Recommended Minimum Punishment:[/bold] 3:00
  [bold]Recommended Maximum Punishment:[/bold] 6:00

## Sects - WIP
### Fire (red altar)

• Bible: greater healing capability, but burns the healer.

• Miracle(s): ability to spawn magic candles and create firesticks (emergency welding tools that can only be used by chaplains and acolytes but don't hurt eyes)

### Technology (technology altar)

• Bible: loses the ability to heal organics, instead heals silicons

• Miracle(s): VERY expensive ability to convert organics into silicons (default borg with medium capacity cell, target has to be willing)

### Greed (NanoTrasen altar)

• Bible: stronger heal, but costs money

• Miracle(s): spawn a random amount of spesos, can convert silver into gold and vice versa.

### Chaos (chaos altar)

• Bible: stronger heal that has a chance of dealing damage instead regardless of a helmet

• Miracle(s): roll the fated die: a d6 with varying negative or positive effects (TBD)

### Nature (druid altar)

• Bible: standard, but is more effective on animals

• Miracle(s): the ability to spawn trees and astro-grass (because normal grass tiles can't be placed)

### Miracle system
Originally inspired by the /tg/station sects, but I realized the possibility of that becoming very gamey so instead it works as follows:
You have a miracle pool that slowly fills up over the course of the round, performing miracles draws from this pool. Could possibly make use of rituals that requires the presence of acolyte(s) to speed up miracle regeneration

## Holy damage

Holy damage is a form of supernatural damage, fueled by the belief of the acolytes and the chaplain.
The primary purpose of holy damage is to provide strength to the chaplain's weapons without it applying to every scenario in the game. It is a form of metaphysical damage that penetrates usual resistances, but will only apply its damage to antagonists with a specific component. That way, the nullrods are still a powerful tool against the occult (heretics and cults) while being rather weak otherwise.
Much like on other servers where it has been implemented and working, holy damage will passively heal itself as the target's spirit recovers from the damage. 

## Technical considerations
• Rebalancing nullrods and the chaplain/acolytes' ability to effectively remove cult rifts.

• Reducing the chaplain's individual combat prowess against cultists and heretics if the addition of acolytes makes them too difficult to face.

• Removing or severely reducing crew's ability to use bibles, thus making it easier on cult as only a few select individuals can reasonably contest them for rifts and exorcise them.

# Game Design rationale

## Seriously silly
These changes would allow for greater roleplay, via the acolytes and a self-sufficient miracle system so chaplains don't have to rely exclusively on prayers anymore for grand sermons. NanoTrasen as a company would want to benefit and control magic use, and I consider the chaplain to be the perfect fit as they typically turn into the authority on the occult during cultist rounds anyway.

## Maintaining Authenticity
With magic no longer explicitly being illegal, I feel like there should be a role that interacts with it in a meaningful way. Currently, it isn't really acknowledged by NanoTrasen at all and there are no structures in place to control or regulate magic in the game, which feels uncharacteristic of a mega-corporation. Introducing a self-regulating miracle system will also help the role of chaplain feel more authentic itself, with the primary focus of miracles being flavour over function. Being able to erect a tree isn't necessarily that useful, but is a beautiful miracle of life and could be used to change the vibe of the chapel significantly.
Developing more identity for each sect will make religion feel more and more authentic within the world.

## Dynamic environment
The chaplain being the local authority on magic will create interesting scenarios where chaplains embrace the magic some antags have to offer - assuming they agree to work for NanoTrasen (Note: it will still be self-antagging to explicitly help cult obviously, you're here to control/eradicate the occult not actively work with it against NanoTrasen's interest). The existence of acolytes creates many new dynamic situations. Their fallibility makes them an interesting role and could be used to cultists' advantage to get close to the chaplain, or create a situation where the acolyte attempts to overtake the chaplain to act as their successor in a bid for more power, etc.
