## Overview

Xenobiology is a new branch in science that deals with treating organisms with gasses, funny chemicals, and other anomalous materials. Scientists can now specialize in three branches, anomalies, xenoarcheology, and xenobiology.

## Background

Xenobiology is a feature beloved in Space Station 13. Science is severely lacking in content, especially in regards to interacting with live critters.

## Features to be added

Science needs a lot of changes to deal with Xenos, but heres the gist of everything that should go into it.

### Xenos and Xeno specific stuff

#### Xenos

Xenos are in round start in their testing chambers, these critters have a higher chance to split earlier and have a better chance of getting more insane combinations. These are your bread and butter, and you want to keep them alive for as long as you can. Cargo may order more of these, but they are expensive as hell. They also have a chance of spawning naturally in maintenence tunnels.

Salvage can also bring these to you, if they're nice enough. Salvage can capture these critters in pet carriers, or in xeno carriers.

Xenos, after eating a certain amount of biomass, lay an egg. Eggs naturally create a single larva, which also needs biomass to survive.

#### Xeno Carriers

Xeno carriers are specialized containers that can hold very hostile organisms. They do not break, and lock just like artifact containers.

#### Larva

Larva are xenos that haven't matured yet. They are worth nothing, but can be influenced. Limbs can be removed, chemicals can be injected, gasses can be pumped in, and more. These influence how Larva grow up. Larva also need a considerable amount of biomass to mature. After reaching a certain threshold, they grow into a Xeno. Specifically what Xeno depends on their mother, as well as the environmental effects during their infancy.

Larva are also very weak, and die easily. They need ideal temperatures and plenty of food. You may also provide a television which will enrich their learning experience.

### Science Tools

#### Critter Point Gun

The critter point gun, is a tool just like the appraisal tool for cargo, that tells researchers how much scientific value is contained within a slime.

#### Critter DNA Analyzer

This is the machine that squishes and squashes critters until they are strung out in a very long DNA ribbon (which kills them), and converts that DNA into research points. Slimes are essentially "cashed in" in exchange for research points.

#### Changes to existing maps

* New Xenobio rooms with at least 2 chambers to conduct experiments in

## Game Design Rationale

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?

# Technical Considerations

- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
