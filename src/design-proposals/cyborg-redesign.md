# Overview

Currently, cyborgs are considered by a lot of the playerbase to be one of the more boring roles to play. The proposed changes here serves as a plan of action for future development to attempt to enrich the role more, and give it more RP presence within rounds.

The changes planned with this rework is for borgs to be more involved with their on station roboticist/acting roboticist. Currently, borgs only visit for upgrades very briefly for better cells, with some chassis not even requiring further upgrades to their modules, leading to a lot of Borg players inadvertently playing against funky's core design philosophy of “RP first.”

In the rework, I'd like to ensure that every single chassis has equal opportunity to visit their roboticist for upgrades to their current chassis, and not being a “one and done” deal upon selection, which some chassis selections suffer from, such as the service chassis or engineering chassis.

The summary of the changes are as follows:

- All borg chassis should start significantly weaker than how they will eventually be in the lategame.
- Each borg chassis should have equal opportunity to get upgrades.
- Borgs should be better than their crew staff counterpart in the lategame on their own.
## Features to be added
***
### Engineering Chassis

This chassis already seems perfectly balanced; I want the other chassis to get buffs to bring those chassis to the same level as this chassis in terms of usage.

***
### Salvage Chassis
Currently, the salvage chassis struggles with the fact it's only useful for mining, and mining only. This leaves salv borgs most of the time separating from the salvage team, as the only benefit they'll have for them is easy repairs in fights. The changes here help the salvage chassis be more useful for salvagers that prefer mags or wrecks, while also keeping them strong in the mining department.
- The salvage chassis now starts with a basic mining module instead of the mining module, containing a radio and pickaxe.
- The normal mining module is now unlocked with research, with salvage equipment.
- Add a salvaging module, moving the shovel and crowbar from the mining module to itself, and adding a fulton slot.
***
### Medical Chassis
This chassis could use some minor buffs, mostly for the lategame.

- Add an advanced topicals module.
- Add soap to the surgery module, or make the advanced surgery module the default. Currently the default surgery module is broken, dirtying without the borg knowing.
- Add a paramed module, giving the borg a medical scanner and other utilities for on the go medical aid as a lategame research.

***
### Service Chassis
This one's a bit of a tricky one, I have been thinking to give it more variety of things it can do. Adding some new modules to help them assist the various departments

- Basic Security (unlocked in a T1 security research): Disabler (one that auto recharges), a slowly recharging flash, slot to hold handcuffs and a space law book.
- Lethal Security (unlocked in a T3 security research, the module is printable in the secfab instead): Rechargeable Laser Riffle, Combat Knife.

The idea of these are that the borgs will need to go to the roboticist or research director to probably get relawed to fit their purpose.

- Administration (unlocked in a T1 civilian research): A pen, cyborg stamp and a slot to grab paper with.
- Command (unlocked in a T2 civilian research): An access configurator, a slot to hold any ID card. (Not sure about this one yet)

More suggestions are always appreciated

### Antag balancing

Currently borgs are a pretty versatile asset for antagonists that choose to convert them, though a major drawback is that generally, it's only science that can even get a chance to EMAG them in most cases.
A traitor could in theory gain AA, or access break the Borg, but I'm fond of the idea of additional methods of EMAGing a Borg.

An idea is that when a borg is crit, the lock on their maintenance panel automatically unlocks. Then only needing to screw the panel open and use the EMAG.
This way it would be a little easier to get a borg as your ally.
