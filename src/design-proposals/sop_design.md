## Overview

SOP is in a weird state right now. It is sometimes extremely relevant to a job and the procedures that role is expected to follow, but other times is never even referenced. My latest PR (and the foundation for this proposal) removed numerous outdated references, including metashielded information, from multiple SOPs. SOP needs a rework to make it more consistent, reliable, and sensible. We should make it reflect the role that it applies to and encourage RP around this system. I would like to establish a small workgroup of departmental experts and contributors willing to work on SOP.
## Background

When I was starting out on Funky SOP was a total mess, it didn't always feel relevant. Playing roles like Security Officer SOP matters a lot, but other roles like Scientist it just felt like nonsense. Security SOP has some organization issue but is overall decent, focusing on the role and providing a good set of IC guidelines. Science SOP, on the other hand, is WAY to focused on non-science things, half of the SOP relates to the front desk, and the rest don't really cover Science at all, focusing on artifact transport or delivering animals to the chef. There are more examples like this throughout the SOP we have, and we need to change it.

## Features to be added

I want to do a full rework of SOP. All SOP will be heavily edited or re-written to align better with the current Funky station gameplay and goals, with a big focus on making it more impactful to regular players. In addition to this, SOP will need have some new changes in organization. I will list out the major changes below.

#### General SOP

Each department should have a "General SOP" that dictates what all members of that department should be doing no matter what, with exceptions for certain roles being listed in that role's SOP. This should make it significantly easier for people to understand what they should be doing, and most importantly will cut down the length of role specific SOP to be drastically shorter.

For example: Warden, HoS, Det all have several lines that cover uniform, which could be condensed into one line under general sop like this: "All Security Roles are expected to wear the uniform as dictated in the Security Code of Conduct, with any additional gear issued to certain positions also being permitted"

This takes out *several* lines of SOP, making it shorter and more comprehensible to everyone.

#### New Sub-SOP

Earlier I mentioned Science SOP focusing on the front desk too much, to solve this I have a simple idea for issues like this. Make a new Sub-SOP for that part of the job. If someone is doing regular science work they do not need to even look at this document, and if someone is doing this part it should be made simple and short. Continuing with the science example, Scientist SOP can be made to focus more on the Science part of the job, with the General SOP containing a line like this: "All Science Roles are expected to adhere to the Front Desk Guidelines when taking orders or processing requests from the crew." This should be a way to regulate things more while having less SOP to read for just doing your main job, and provide more of a reference sheet then pure SOP.

#### New Alert SOP

Alert SOP sucks. It does. Sorry to whoever made it but it doesn't align with what we need now. Alert SOP should be removed and replaced with Alert based SOP for certain roles/departments, similar to how Security SOP is set up now. This reduces the number of SOP people need to look at and makes it easier to understand, especially when you consider the fact that for most alert levels, something has gone wrong.

#### Seriously Silly SOP

I want more Funky SOP to be Seriously Silly. A perfect example of this (and my favorite SOP) is the Clown's first SOP, which allows them to slip LITERALLY ANYONE! This is hilarious and we should have more examples of it. SOP should be written like it is 90% what the role should be doing, and 10% what some out of touch bureaucrat would think that roles does or just something that's a funny addition. SOP should help people know what they should be doing but also encourage some of that sweet IAA/CC RP.

#### SOP Number/Referencing

I would also like to figure out a system for SOP to be easily referenced in paperwork or just quicker in general. Something like: [Department]-Role-Alert-Number or [Sec]-Officer-Blue-2. This should make communicating specific SOP easier. This is just an example and certain considerations need to me made in terms of how specific we want referencing to be and how or if it should be in the documents.

#### SOP Formatting Guide

A guide for future contributors on how SOP has been formatted should be created to keep things consistent. I made a PR formatting a lot of SOP but we need to formalize how we do it so it can stay consistent in future PRs.

## Game Design Rationale

SOP should be a feature that encourages RP, and right now it is really.. eh. I have seen good SOP RP, but current SOP is often too outdated to apply to how a role is played. I think a rework is needed to make SOP more accessible to the players and to bring it in line with what we want for Funky.

## Roundflow & Player interaction

SOP is not going to be a part of every role, and that's fine. For some roles it should come up when they fuck up, and for others it should be a core part of it. Departments like Security and Command will have SOP be more of a factor, making it matter a lot more. I believe that this will also make roles like IAA more important, while also allowing a quasi-guide for what that role should do.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?

    SOP is enforced in-character, but seeing as this is meant to make SOP easier for everyone, this should hopefully reduce the admin intervention for SOP.

- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?

    No. In-character disputes are likely, but that's RP, that's why we are here.

- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?

    Same as the current system, in-character RP via CC staff.

# Technical Considerations

- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?

    No way.

- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?

    Only changes to the guidebook, but no UI or new systems.

- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
