## Overview

Each round the NTR will be given a “corporate interest” that is their duty to see completed by the end of the shift. These are objectives that will often put them at odds with the crew and even command to a degree. This is a way to push NTRs and CC to use their power over others and create tension and conflict between the three levels of station members (crew, command, CC).

## Background

Currently there is too much camaraderie across all crew aligned characters. NT is supposed to be an evil and soulless organization and the interests of crew vs command vs central command should conflict with each other far more than they currently do in game.

Command members often seem more loyal to the crew than NT. CC usually plays the role of annoying rules lawyers (which is fun but shouldn’t be ALL they do) instead of overbearing and uncaring enforcers of corporate interests.
CC needs more incentive to really embody the role of the evil corporate overlords they are. 

Command members shouldn’t be able to chum up to their subordinates without finding themselves in an extremely difficult situation when CC inevitably reminds them where their loyalty should truly lie. Any command member who truly and actively cares for their crew’s interests over that of NT should quickly find themselves in a position where they must either give up their soul or lose their job.

This proposed change is at least a step towards creating the class conflict dynamic that is desired for funky. NT and crew should be at constant odds with each other and command should be stuck in the middle, having to balance keeping the crew just content enough not to revolt with keeping centcom happy enough not to fire them.


## Features to be added

The sole feature this document proposes is the corporate interest objective that will be given to the NTR on round start or when they arrive.
The magistrate would likely also be aware of this objective but IAAs and command members are to be informed at the discretion of the NTR. 

How the NTR will go about completing this objective is up to them and the objectives themselves will all incentivize leveraging the power that CC has over command and crew.
Some of these objectives may be considered very sensitive information and could easily risk rioting or other extreme forms of insubordination if the crew at large becomes aware. They may also deal with certain corporate secrets and necessitate an extra degree of discretion.

Ideally this objective will be automatically sent in the form of a fax to the NTR’s office. Having to reference an in game piece of paper adds a level of interest and potential drama as that paper may be seen by eyes it wasn’t meant for.

Some of these objectives will come with alterations to how things are spawned round start and would need to have their chance of being selected removed in the case of a late join NTR.

Here are some examples of corporate interests:

Lost command manual: It has been reported that a lost command manual containing corporate secrets is somewhere on board. Secure it and silence any crew deemed a liability to maintaining these secrets. Do this by any means necessary. Take no risks.

Zombie specimen: A small amount of the bio weapon drug known as romeral has been found on station and is now in your possession. Ensure that an animal on board is infected and their condition progresses to the final stage of zombification. This condition must progress through each stage of infection so ensure the animal is not killed through any other means. This animal must be larger than a mothroach and may not be cube grown. Ensure they are secure and do not allow this infection to spread. They must be discreetly brought in “live” zombie form to the CC outpost so they can be transported to a specialized research facility.

Drug testing: The following chemical drug is in the experimental stage and we need results from human testing (drug is a chemical with randomly generated effects). Divulging this to as few members of the crew as possible, ensure this drug is discreetly tested on X amount of people with the results recorded and faxed to CC.

Downsizing: Ensure that X amount of crew are fired before shift’s end including at least 1 command member. The former crew must have their ID’s downgraded to visitor status and have all job related equipment and clothing reclaimed from them.

Loyalty testing: Orchestrate the conducting of thorough loyalty tests for all command members and X amount of crew. You are not required to conduct these tests personally. Just see that it is done. Documentation of each test including a loyalty rating from 1 to 5 is to be faxed to CC.

Secure and contain: We believe there may be dangerous individuals on board with knowledge or abilities that may prove to be valuable assets in our research of the unknown. At least one of these individuals must be contained and brought alive to the CC outpost to be transported to a secret research facility. The abilities they possess may not be removed or suppressed. (Can appear in rounds with changelings, wizards, heretics, or either forms of cultists).

Major deficit: Our regional commander accidentally misplaced 200000 spesos during the previous quarter and we need a windfall to make up that deficit. You are to obtain that money and arrive with it in your briefcase by any means necessary.

Priviliged hospitality: The regional commander had to leave the sector on business and their son is bored. You are to protect and entertain his son by any means necessary. (Spawns a ghost role for the son with the objective of "be as shitty and demanding of the station as possible")

Interests like “drug testing” may require additional features being added. Features like this could very well see use outside of the interest they were created for. Drug testing’s randomized chemical potentially being found in maints pills for one example.

Planned future content will allow for more and more memorable interests to be added. Xenobiology or virology forced to create bio weapons for NT, genetics making super soldiers or mutations that suppress free will in some way, payment of scribs could be docked from the department deemed least productive and given to that deemed most productive in an “incentivise competition” interest etc.

Most of the examples given are on the more extreme end as I think that’s where this feature could shine the most. However, less extreme interests like “loyalty testing” should be plentiful to maintain the impact of these extreme cases and keep them from being overly intrusive to the average round.


## Game Design Rationale

### Seriously Silly
The setting is largely a satirical space age corporate hell which is inherently seriously silly. This addition seeks to bring that satire to new levels in game.
One scenario could see the NTR getting the “drug testing” interest and telling CMO they must discreetly test the drug on patients. The patient (who originally came in with moderate blunt damage) burns from the inside out after receiving the injection and requires extensive surgery. After trying their best to come up with an explanation for their doctors, the CMO goes to the NTR to tell them how much of a catastrophic failure the test was. The NTR replies “That’s unfortunate but CentCom clearly mandated it be tested on 6 separate patients. You have 5 more to go.”

### Maximizing Roleplay Potential
I believe the roleplay potential is the biggest strength of this proposal. Not just for the NTR but for every player in the round. NTRs and other CC members will get to act as their own flavors of soulless corporate big wigs as they leverage their powerful positions in new and interesting ways. 

Command members will be stuck between their crew and the power of an uncaring NT. Will they be full loyalists? Quietly resenting but compliant? Will they take a stand and risk all the consequences that come from that?

Security may be forced to realize their true role is the enforcers of command and not true upholders of justice and peace.

Crew would have much more motivation to take a stand on something since they have far less to lose. Protests and riots should be more likely to happen. Antagonizing command and CC over their actions would lead to a lot of interesting character conflict. 
They are also far less likely to have any concrete knowledge on just what CC and command are up to. Distrust, conspiracy theories, rationalizing, avoidance etc. there are countless ways to roleplay in these new scenarios.


## Roundflow & Player interaction

Every round with an NTR on station will include them pursuing the corporate interest in the background. These objectives will vary widely as will the level to which they impact the round.
One round may see command and a handful of crew interviewed by IAAs (or even the psychologist if the NTR involves them) to measure their loyalty for NT with the results of those tests further driving roleplay for a mere handful of players.
Another round may see whoever the NTR gets involved in the “zombie specimen” interest making a mistake and unknowingly becoming infected, leading to a full blown outbreak.
Most rounds would be on the lower end of impact but all will benefit from the added flavor and drama.
These objectives are all rooted in roleplay and direct player interaction.


## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

The conflict oriented nature of corporate interests may push escalation rules to their limits and the non antag status of the NTR could cause some confusion or wariness with how players can react to their more harmful behavior. 

There may also be some issues with some objectives giving the NTR the ability to see out plans that would otherwise break server rules. The main factor that may cause issues here is the way they see out these plans is often through ordering those below them to take direct action.
Command and crew should be allowed to follow any order given by any centcomm official without risk of admin intervention. The responsibility should be on the CC officials to not give out orders that would break server rules. This is reinforced by the fact that they have a direct in character connection to the admins through their communications with CentCom.

Initially there may very well be an increased admin workload before players adjust to a more adversarial relationship with command and CC officials but I believe this would level out fairly quickly.


# Technical Considerations

Nothing for the most part. I don’t know how chems are coded but the drug testing idea may require some changes. The vast majority of interests would incorporate systems that already exist.
