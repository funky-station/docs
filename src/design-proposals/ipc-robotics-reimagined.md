# IPCs & Robotics Reimagined

IPCs are a species of autonomous silicon lifeforms not bound by the usual Silicon rounds. They are a roundstart species on servers such as Delta-V, and in fact used to be a roundstart species on Funky station. They were however, removed for a variety of reasons, some more valid than others. This of course, raises the question: why? Why propose to return them? They were surely removed for a good reason, and frankly, everyone is tired of talking about IPCs. The reasons for removing them have been gone over in exhaustive details and, to be blunt, they are very valid and important reasons. However, where others saw this problem as one with no solution, I see an opportunity to not only create an interesting species but to also reimagine a role sorely needing in more things to do; Robotocist. 

In this design document, I will share my proposal for IPCs and their entanglement with robotics. I will go over the reasons they were removed, and systematically demonstrate how each and every one of these problems can be solved with alternative systems that will not only be fun, but also add to the setting and lore of the game in a way that furthers the cyberpunk evil megacorporation vibe.

## Why were IPCs removed?

IPCs were removed for a variety of reasons. So many that if you ask anyone, they all will give you a different reason! Here, I will go over each of those reasons, and why they are in fact pretty good reasons to remove IPCs. Consider this a summary and review of the species as it once existed, and why simply going back to that is not tenable. These reasons are listed in ascending order of least important to most important, although each of these need to be addressed.

### Game Balance
IPCs were, bluntly, broken. They were immune to some antagonists (changelings), they did not need to visit medical at all and could self-weld themselves, they had weird resistances, didn't need to breathe (though they were still vulnerable to spacing without upgrades). While I believe trying to perfectly balance any game is a Sisyphean, pointless endeavour, there should still be SOME considerations for game balance, especially in egregious cases such as this. Were game balance the only reason for removal, I believe IPCs would have been fixed rather easily. Unfortuantely, there are other reasons IPCs were removed.

### Non-interaction with Game Systems
IPCs don't interact with the medical department. At all. To be honest, I don't really care that much about this -- I don't think every player should have to interact with every department. But some developers at Funky care a lot about this, and fair enough. I believe there is an alternative way to fix this, however, which I will discuss in my solutions section of the document.

### Setting Incongruity
IPCs as they existed were extremely dissonant with the setting that Funky Station (and honestly, most Space Station servers) tries to present. Essentially, there's a rather obvious question looming over every IPC created; why not just make a borg? Law-bound borgs are capable of doing most things IPCs can (granted, without hands and more specialized), but they are forced to obey, are the property of NanoTrasen, and most importantly don't need to be paid. So why would NanoTrasen build robots that cannot be controlled in the same manner and need to be paid? There are numerous workarounds, such as IPCs somehow being "cheaper" to make (I find this rather silly), but many are contrived. Rather than working around this issue, I intend to offer several complete rewrite solutions.

## What about Robotics?
Robotics is an interesting role. Part of the science department, they are in charge of maintaining borgs and building mechs. However, in practice this means they kind of don't really have much to do most of the time, and end up acting as a normal scientist once they have a few posibrains descrambling and some borgs built. There has been talk of merging robotics into general science, and if things remain this way, I think that is the ultimate fate of robotics. However, I believe the role has tons of potential, especially if something like IPCs as I envision them are added back to the game. 

## Game Balance
The primary advantages of IPCs are the need to not bleed, the ability to repair themselves with a simple weld, and the fact they don't need to eat or sleep. This was meant to be offset by the fact that they have to recharge, but it's honestly too easy to work around. They also had extra weakness to heat, which is interesting, but not all too significant on its own.

I think IPCs not having to breathe is fine, honestly, so long as other drawbacks make up for it, of which I have several in mind. 

### Implants? No Thanks
IPCs are not biological constructs, so the fact they can use implants has never made sense to me. By removing implants from IPCs, we automatically nerf their antagonist potential. Instead of implants, IPCs will need discrete hardware upgrades, which will mechanically be implants but with a far limited selection; only Mindshield and Pacifism, at least at first. No storage implant, scram implant, EMP implant, or any other sort of implants. An Acidify / Lifeline equivilent could also be considered.

### A Medical Overhaul & Robotics
First, we give IPCs synthblood, just like the synthetic trait gives. Then, we make it so individual damage types matter on an IPC, just like they do on any organic player species. Welding becomes bandaging for IPCs, stopping bleading, but that's it. 

A new suite of topicals are introduced which are created by the robotocist, and used to heal different types of damage. There could also be IPC-specific chems. More details on this will be covered in the Interaction with Game Systems section of this document.

From a gamebalance perspective, this makes IPCs harder to heal and more killable. No more casually welding yourself in a corner to fix an injury -- you need to be healed the same way as everyone else.

### Souls and DNA
IPCs in this conception have souls. More details in the lore section, but essentially, they can be sacrificed by heretics and cultists. They will leave a bio-signature on objects if they are not wearing gloves. The only antagonist Im having a hard time squaring are Changelings -- I don't see a way to make it possible for IPCs to be changelings. That said, I believe we could still allow Changelings to consume IPCs, just not transform into them.

### Vulnerabilities
In addition to heat damage, I believe IPCs should be particularly vulnerable to spacing. Their chasses are fragile in comparison to borg chasses, and without upgrades or an EVA suit, they should take significantly more spacing damage than other species. This will (ideally) balance out the fact they don't need to breathe. I'm envisioning it as spacing dealing far more blunt damage to IPCs, representing their chasses getting compressed from the pressureloss. 

## Interaction with Game Systems
I've been a game designer for some years now, and I believe that not every player needs to interact with every game system. Players approach games differently, and that's fine. However, I do believe that in a game like SS14, if someone does not have to interact with one system, there *should be a replacement system* that they are required to interact with instead. This is where I see the potential to kill two birds with one stone, by making Robotics responsible for IPC maintenance.

### Robotics as Doctors
As detailed in the Medical Overhaul section, IPCs will now take damage normally. A simple weld will not suffice to heal. Instead, they will require topicals to be administrated to them. These topicals will be creatable (mostly with plastic, steel and LV cables) by the robotocist, who can then apply them to injured IPCs who come to their office. We make it part of Robotocist SOP that they are responsible for IPC repairing and wellness. We could even potentially expand this to all borgs, requiring proper medical treatment (not just welds) for normal borgs as well, with welding serving purely stopping bleeds.

Robotocists would also be responsible for upgrading IPCs should they wish them, performing surgery on them and giving their chasses upgrades. Additionally, we would make it explicit that ANY cybernetic upgrades for ANY crew must be done by the robotocist -- Medical surgeons can *only* do bio-synthetic prosthetics and lifesaving surgeries. Any operation involving a cybernetic, or any surgery on an IPC, MUST be done by the robotocist.

IPCs would not be able to receive cryogenic care. If their limbs are damaged beyond repair, it is far simpler to just replace their limb with a new IPC limb. Likewise, if they are too damaged, it is easier to transfer their brain to a new chassis.

### Paramedic Training
As part of their SOP, Paramedics would be instructed to bring any injured IPCs to the Robotocist. They could carry a few robotic topicals with them for emergency care. We would have to give them robotics access of course, and potentially even relocate robotics on some maps, but I think this is very much do-able. 

### Chems?
An idea I'm less sure on is the idea of having a special set of chems that work on IPCs. It would add some complexity, but it would also ensure more departmental interlocking; chemistry would have to maintain some IPC chems, and send them to the robotocist.

## Setting Compatibility
IPCs raise an important question: Why would NanoTrasen create IPCs, when they have borgs? It's a very good question, and I have a few ideas to fix it. The simplest idea is that NanoTrasen merely employs IPCs; they don't make them. In this conception, IPCs are either from their own self-replicating mechanical civilization, or are simply made by individuals on an ad-hoc basis. This has the disadvantage of making it somewhat difficult to explain how NT would be able to maintain IPC parts, however.

Another idea is that they are simply bodies provided to the MMIs of important NT personnel who they don't want to borg. This has the problem of meaning the species would have to somehow be inherently limited, and isn't really much of a solution at all in my view.

My last idea, however, is a bit more exciting and ties into my previous notes on DNA and souls; IPCs are partially organic. They do not have Positronic brains at all (meaning you can't put any borg brain in one), and instead have some sort of advanced, hybrid brain that has an organic component. Whether it is compatible with MMIs or not, I am not sure, but it would essentially be a unique biosynthetic brain. This organic component requires synthblood to survive, and is entirely incompatible with borg chasses (without a potential MMI). In Isaac Asimov's conception of the laws of robotics, the laws are not merely something enforced on robots; they are a *necessary byproduct* of their existence, as fundamental as neural synapses are to human life. Therefore, it would make sense for a lawless silicon to simply not have a positronic brain, and have something else entirely.

Because of the organic component, they have some measure of DNA (but not enough to do genetics stuff). This can be extracted by changelings -- and can be used to identify IPCs as well, with DNA evidence being left behind unless the IPC removes evidence from their gloves/whatever they have touched. 

Of course, this still leaves another question: why would NanoTrasen make them at all? They are no longer in the same category as borgs, but borgs still have their uses, and laws are useful. I have two responses to that. The first, we allow the synthetic trait -- which is mostly used for characters who are synthetic constructs of NT without laws binding them who are presumably paid. The same logic could be applied to the synthetic trait, but we don't, and I find that interesting.

The second is less whataboutism and more a real solution; NanoTrasen is an abusive parent. Abusive parents will often on their adult children use something to the effect of "I raised you, so you owe me everything". With NT, we turn this up to eleven. By being created by NT, you owe them. You agreed to a contract to work for them, indefinitely, to pay off the cost of your creation, *before you were even born and before you could sign it*. You are an employee, like everyone else... and you're essentially an indentured servant, like everyone else. This idea, I feel, fits with the theming of NanoTrasen on Funky, while the advantages of autonomous decision makers explains the rationale for making them in teh first place.

## Why Though?
IPCs were removed for technical debt reasons, and the reasons above. It is fair to ask: why relitigate this? Why bother at all? It's a solved problem. Which, honestly, fair enough. The strongest argument I have, I think, is that it gives robotics something to do. Remember, this isn't just a proposed IPC reintroduction -- but a reworking of an entire role, to give them an actual purpose. I also feel that many of the ideas here (especially the medical stuff) can be ported to normal borgs.

Another answer I have is that I think removing things is bad. Yes, sometimes you just have to, and yes, with IPCs it was ostensibly the last resort but I think my solutions are novel. If we can bring something back that people liked, we should.

A third answer, and my least persuasive, is that I like robot people. Yeah, yeah, furslop (synthslop?) and all that, but sometimes, you just make things because you like them. I'm aware that many on the staff don't like the idea of IPCs out of principal. However, Taydeo told me to give this document a shot (despite being a certified hater of IPCs themselves!). So bluntly, I don't care if you personally dislike IPCs. What I do care about is interesting game design and solutions to difficult problems, and I think I have provided both of those. All I ask is that you keep an open mind. I am open to feedback and changes.

## Implementation
Here comes the toughest pill to swallow.

I do not think the IPC code as it exists right now is salvagable. I believe that we will have to completely rewrite IPCs from the ground up, using little or even no code from the original species. Honestly, it deviates so much from IPCs that we might as well even rename the species and just use the visual assets; the only thing this has in common with original IPCs is "robot person".

This is, bluntly, a lot of work. It's work, however, that I want to do -- but I don't want to do it if it's 100% certain to be rejected, which is why I submit this as a design document first. If you're not interested, that's fine, but I'm going to make this eventually anyway, if not for Funky, then for a different fork.

## Challenges
### Pros
- Returns removed content to the game
- Gives robotics something to do
- Lots of people like IPCs (yes this is a positive)

### Cons
- Technical debt 
- Rewrite is almost certainly needed
- Taydeo doesn't like IPCs :frowning:

## Addendum
This is very much a draft proposal. I am open to making changes, but I want initial thoughts and feedback.
