Overview:
Space Station is a game about chaos, dying in hilarious ways, and a normal boring shift where you sometimes become an evil monster from space or make the chemical compound for meth. However, a lot of the time good RP is undermined by a hero/villain mentality. Death is easy to recover from, life can be short and unmeaningful, and its hard enforce an RP culture around that.

Background:
Current Funky is an MRP server with LRP interactions and goals. Crew does not fear death, Antags cannot force that upon them, so it leads to valid hunting and low roleplay altercations where people do not need to value their lives. To this point, Funky has a robust and incredibly powerful medical system, making sure as long as its not overrun with bodies it can get anyone up in a few minutes. This actively hurts crew, since they don't need to give into demands or rp around their death, and it trivalizes the concept. Good solid RP should come from understanding your job upon a NT station might have nothing happen, or you might never walk again. Valuation of life is sorely needed.

Features To Be Added:
Adding more lethality to guns/melee to ensure people are not bullet sponges/capable of ignoring the threat of weaponry
Limiting Medical's ability to heal any wounds or injury with ease
Rules changes and admin policy(explained below)
Removing any and all win/lose conditions for antagonists(Removing green text/ C menu HUD marcation of 'completed/failed')

Game Design Rationale:
Funky is MRP first and foremost. A blend of wacky events mixed with heartfelt or jawdropping moments. Chaos can and will happen on even the most mundane shifts, and we want to encourage and explore that through RP. However, death is part of RP. While only a mechanic in a video game, it is part of an in character motivation to live your best life and care when it's about to end. These design changes and incentivizations help shape and focus that mentality, both with game staff rules but also mechanical consistency.

Roundflow & Player Interaction:
This change will affect every round. Pace is determined by character RP and willingness to understand and cooperate with hostile and unfamiliar rolepplay scenarios.
Players should treat each life they live on NT's Funky Station as if they were a real worker. Accidents can happen, but you know that it won't to you and you certainly won't die forever. Players should NOT interact as if this is a gunsim, or more punishing ways to play to win. This is a discouragement of LRP combat and more importantly ignoring Fear RP.

Administrative/Server Rules Impact:
This direction has two major impacts: a more strict enforcement for command/sec and a relaxation for antagonist's rules.
Firstly: If you as command or security actively ignore direct threats or dangers to the station in order to play to win(causing death for objective protecting etc) you will face a punishment from staff for this behavior. A good example of this is not giving up a digiboard while a traitor threatens to detonate a bomb killing everyone in med. 
Secondly: If a person attempts to valid hunt or run down an antagonist as crew with the intent to stop them without genuine reason to do so, that antagonist should be allowed to prevent their revival in order to SEVERELY discourage such behavior in the future from that player.
This can incentivize griefing or rule breaking, but it will be covered by both visible server rules and an understanding of Funky's standards of MRP.
Executions, spacing, body poisoning, etc, are easy already made implementations to enforce this mechanically. Removal of greentext and win/lose conditions will also encourage command/sec to be more open to such RP.

Technical Considerations:
No major impacts on technicals. However this will change round flow and Funky's design flow moving forward with other features.
