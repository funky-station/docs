# Genetics and Mutations systems

## Overview

Genetics is a new medical/science feature that lets crew scan, sequence, and modify DNA to unlock mutations ranging from typical accents and traits to powerful (and dangerous) abilities.  
Every round, all mutations receive completely unique 32-base DNA sequences that players must discover through experimentation. Correctly sequencing a block activates the mutation; adding too many non-natural mutations causes genetic instability that can spiral into random harmful mutations that cannot be undone or even persistant cellular damage.

The system is built around three pieces of equipment (DNA Scanner + Console, DNA Injectors, Handheld Genetic Analyzer) and emphasises risk/reward, cooperation, and chaotic late-round escalation.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Put a living test subject in the DNA Scanner.
2. Use the DNA Scanner Console to view their partially hidden DNA blocks.
3. Click bases in the sequencer grid to guess the correct sequence (each click deals 0.2 cellular damage).
4. When a block is fully correct, the mutation activates automatically.
5. Save discovered mutations to the console's storage and print single-use injectors (activator to turn on an existing mutation, mutator to add a new one).
6. Too much instability = bad things happen.

## Key Mechanics

### Round-Unique DNA Sequences
- At round start every mutation prototype is randomly assigned a block (1–150) and a unique 32-base sequence (valid A-T / G-C pairs).
- Sequences never repeat between rounds.

### Genetic Instability
- Non-natural mutations add/subtract instability.
- Over 100 instability and you will have between 60 and 90 seconds until a random severe negative mutation occurs.
- Over 150 instability and you will recieve constant cellular damage.
- Radiation or unstable mutagen exposure can also trigger random mutations.

### Mutation Removal & Resistance
- Mutadone removes almost everything.
- Specific mutations can be flagged mutadone-resistant, sequencer-resistant, or scramble-resistant.
- “Scramble DNA” (30 s cooldown, 25 cellular damage) resets the genome except resistant mutations.

### Discovery Persistence
- Once a mutation is fully sequenced on a grid, its name is permanently revealed to every console and handheld analyzer on that grid. This could potentially be used to have the discovery of certain or rare mutations contribute to the station's research points. 

## Equipment

**DNA Scanner**  
A pod that holds one occupant. Occupants are inserted by dragging and dropping (2-second entry delay). The scanner links to a console via the device network.

**DNA Scanner Console**  
Full-featured UI showing subject vitals, mutation list with partially hidden sequences, sequencer grid/buttons, saved mutation storage, and printing controls. Starts with 60 empty injectors in stock.

**DNA Injector – Activator (blue)**  
Single-use syringe that activates an existing block in the target already possesses (2-second do-after).

**DNA Injector – Mutator (red)**  
Single-use syringe that adds a new block and immediately activates it, increasing instability if it is not part of the target’s base genome.

**Handheld Genetic Analyzer**  
Portable scanner that instantly displays all blocks and current revealed sequences. Can print a formatted paper report with block numbers and sequences. Requires a small power cell.

Empty injectors are lathe-printable trash items.

## Important Departure from SS13-Style Genetics

Unlike SS13, monkeys **cannot** be turned back into humans. Instead, they simply have fewer sequences to examine. This is a deliberate design choice:

- There is currently no safe, generic “spawn human” system in SS14.
- Reversing monkey transformations would interfere with changeling mechanics, cargo organ bounties, and other systems that treat human corpses as a limited resource.
- The monkey mutation is intended as a permanent, hilarious punishment for extreme instability rather than a reversible state.

## Example Mutations (21 currently implemented)

**Speech / Accents** (0 instability)  
Cowboy, Pirate, Russian, Southern, Stuttering, Frontal Lisp, etc.

**Quirks & Disabilities**  
Pacifism, Narcolepsy, Total Blindness, Mute, Chronic Snoring, etc.

**Beneficial**  
Alcohol Immunity, Supermatter Hallucination Immunity.

**Instability Punishments**  
Permanent Monkey Transformation (hidden, mutadone/sequencer/scramble-resistant, non-printable, human-only).

All mutations are prototype-based and easy to add or tweak.

## Round Flow Impact
- **Early round** — Geneticist begins work on available monkeys, scanning crew members with their handheld scanner to find missing parts of sequences.
- **Mid round** — Radiation exposures lead to random mutations in crew, giving the geneticist a chance to examine undsicovered mutations. Advanced and hidden mutations begin to unlock from discovering and saving their precursors. 
- **Late round** — Many beneficial and unique mutations are found and applied to crew. If rare mutations generate research points, geneticists may start trying to discover instability mutations just to contribute. 

Mutations should remain balanced in design. Their instability and drawbacks should be carefully considered to self-regulate abuse


## Balance & Safety

- 2 second injection time and break on damage/movement to prevent quick injections.
- Instability risks discourage spamming powerful mutations.
- Nearly all mutations, apart from instability mutations, are removable, preventing the player from feeling round-long loss of control over their character.

## Technical Notes

- Mutations simply apply the components provided in the prototype.
